# Roadmap

This is a living roadmap outlining upcoming work. Timelines are indicative and may change.

## Q4 2025
- API consolidation: remove duplicate register/dev-login routes and add redirects where needed.
- Health & Cron unification: extract shared modules and refactor endpoints/functions.
- Prisma datasource variable standardization and docs alignment.
- CI guardrails: Semgrep rules, duplicate import/file checks, performance budgets enforced.

## Q1 2026
- OpenAPI coverage expansion (beyond admin-services) and client SDK generation.
- Improved multi-tenant tooling (tenant switch UX, audit trails, data export tooling).
- Observability: richer SLO dashboards using monitoring/ assets and Sentry performance.

## Backlog
- Accessibility polish across admin/portal.
- Advanced RBAC tooling (single entry script with audit mode).
- Demo data bootstrap for quick onboarding.
