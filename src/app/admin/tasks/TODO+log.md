# Admin Tasks Enhancements â€” TODO + Log

Date: ${new Date().toISOString()}

## Scope
- Add AdvancedAnalytics tabs (overview, performance, compliance, revenue) with safe fallbacks
- Add filter panel integrated with FilterProvider and admin APIs
- Wire components into /admin/tasks
- Future: Watchers/Reminders/Dependencies UI in TaskDetailsModal

## Progress Log
- Created components: components/analytics/AdvancedAnalytics.tsx, components/filters/TaskFiltersPanel.tsx
- Wired into page: src/app/admin/tasks/page.tsx (toggle filters, added analytics)
- Notes: Revenue/Compliance require backend schema changes; UI shows placeholders until data exists

## Next Steps
- Consider DB schema updates to support compliance/revenue fields

## Completed
- Added read-only Watchers, Reminders, Dependencies sections to TaskDetailsModal
