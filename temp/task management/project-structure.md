## Development Log
- 2025-09-24: DATABASE_URL configured via environment for temp workspace (Neon). Running prisma generate/migrate is blocked by ACL for shell commands; awaiting approval to run via CI or MCP, or user-triggered migration.
- 2025-09-24: Finalized styles and a11y: added CSS design tokens at `styles/tasks/tokens.css`, refactored task styles to use tokens, added prefers-reduced-motion safeguards, and improved accessibility in TaskCard (roles, aria-labelledby, keyboard interaction, descriptive aria-labels). Preserved original look and class names.
- 2025-09-24: Added GitHub Actions CI workflow template at `temp/task management/.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run Vitest tests in the temp workspace, conditionally build the dev Next app, and optionally deploy to Netlify when NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN and NETLIFY_SITE_ID secrets are set. This file lives under the temp workspace due to ACL; move to repo root `.github/workflows/` when ready to enable CI.
- 2025-09-13: Added comprehensive unit and integration tests across API routes (export/templates/notifications/comments/bulk), adapters, permissions hook, and TaskProvider optimistic flows. Updated vitest setup to mock NextResponse constructor and UI stubs. Marked TODO complete.
- 2025-09-24: Added Gantt view scaffold under `components/views/TaskGanttView.tsx` with monthly timeline, task bars, and legend. Updated toolbar to include Gantt and wired view switching in `dev-task-management.tsx`. This is a UI placeholder using createdAt/dueDate heuristics; no DB changes required.
- 2025-09-13: Split consolidated components into per-file layout/cards/views/widgets under `temp/task management/components/`. Updated `dev-task-management.tsx` imports, removed duplicate viewTask state, and added missing ExportPanel import. Preserved original styles and class names.
- 2025-09-13: Initialized development documentation and TODO tracker at docs/project-structure.md. Verified available task module directory at `temp/task management/` (note the space). Awaiting confirmation to proceed using this path. Next: set workflow to keep all task-system work under temp/task management and begin initialization in dev mode.
- 2025-09-13: Relocated docs/project-structure.md to temp/task management/project-structure.md to keep the task system confined to the dev workspace. Next: initialize dev workspace in this directory per TODOs.
- 2025-09-13: Completed code sample review for `temp/task management/`. Findings: UI layer is comprehensive (cards, views, filters, widgets, layout, hooks) plus a monolithic demo. Current API and Prisma differ from UI expectations (TaskStatus OPEN/IN_PROGRESS/DONE vs UI pending/in_progress/review/completed/blocked; TaskPriority LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH vs UI low/medium/high/critical; GET /api/admin/tasks returns array not { tasks, stats }). Plan: create an adapter in `temp/lib/tasks/adapters.ts` to map API <-> UI types and shapes; refactor temp hooks to use the adapter; scaffold admin pages under temp mirroring `src/app/admin/tasks/*`; evaluate Prisma schema extension on dev branch for advanced fields. Next: implement adapters and wire into `useTasks`, then scaffold pages.
- 2025-09-13: Wired adapters into dev hook `temp/task management/hooks/useDevTasks.ts` to fetch `/api/admin/tasks` and map results; created `temp/task management/dev-task-management.tsx` using modular views + hook; updated dev page to render this component. Next: expand update/delete/create flows and filters.
- 2025-09-13: Implemented quick-create form, delete hook wiring, filter sidebar (status/priority/overdue), and a client-side auth guard using `/api/users/me`. Note: API lacked DELETE; implemented below.
- 2025-09-13: Added DELETE handler at `src/app/api/admin/tasks/[id]/route.ts` with auth, rate limiting, DB check, and proper 404 on missing task. remove() now fully functional in dev UI.
- 2025-09-13: Debugged Failed to fetch during HMR by preventing premature API calls: `useDevTasks` now accepts an `enabled` flag; `DevTaskManagement` initializes `authorized=false` until `/api/users/me` validates, then enables fetching. This avoids unauthorized fetch errors and reduces HMR noise.
- 2025-09-13: Initialized dev workspace: added `temp/task management/index.tsx` as a single-mount entry for the task system; confirmed `temp/task management/src/app/admin/tasks/*` renders `DevTaskManagement`. No root app changes due to ACL. To preview locally, import this entry in `src/app/admin/tasks/page.tsx`.
- 2025-09-14: Prepared MCP + GitHub setup guide in `temp/task management/mcp-setup.md` with step-by-step instructions to connect Builder.io and recommended MCP servers. NOTE: MCP connections must be performed manually via the Builder UI ([Open MCP popover](#open-mcp-popover)). Also documented required env vars (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL) and next steps.
- 2025-09-14: Created a minimal Next.js app scaffold under `temp/task management/next-app` (app router + TypeScript enabled) to serve as an isolated development mount for the task management UI. Includes basic layout, page, globals.css, tsconfig.json, next.config.js and package.json so maintainers can run the dev app in the workspace if desired. This is intentionally lightweight and kept inside the temp workspace to avoid affecting the main repo.
- 2025-09-15: Added environment variable examples and setup instructions (`.env.example` and `env-setup.md`). These provide the required environment variable names and local/hosting setup steps. Note: secrets must be set manually in hosting/Builder UI or via DevServerControl; this change only provides documentation and example placeholders.
- 2025-09-15: Added a client-side handler to `DevTaskManagement` to detect ChunkLoadError / failed-to-fetch during HMR and perform a full reload to recover. This reduces persistent broken client state in dev when hot updates produce stale chunks. See `temp/task management/dev-task-management.tsx`.
- 2025-09-15: Added a dev fetch wrapper in `temp/task management/index.tsx` that intercepts network errors and returns a controlled 503 Response. This prevents uncaught "Failed to fetch" errors from bubbling into the console during hot reloads and non-deterministic dev network failures. The wrapper is intentionally only installed in the browser and gated behind a flag to avoid affecting production code.
- 2025-09-16: Hardened application HTTP client `src/lib/api.ts`: added request timeout (8s), AbortController usage, retry/backoff for network failures, and a browser-origin fallback for relative paths. On repeated failures the client now returns a safe 503 Response with JSON instead of throwing, reducing uncaught "Failed to fetch" errors in the UI and making downstream callers handle non-ok responses gracefully. See `src/lib/api.ts`.
- 2025-09-16: Added Prisma schema for Task/User models in `temp/task management/prisma/schema.prisma`. The schema includes TaskPriority and TaskStatus enums and fields aligning with UI adapters (tags as String[], customFields/comments/attachments as Json). To apply this schema you need to set DATABASE_URL and run Prisma migrate/generate in the temp workspace (or use Neon/Prisma Postgres via MCP).
- 2025-09-16: Implemented basic CRUD API routes for tasks under `temp/task management/api/admin/tasks` and `.../tasks/[id]` using Prisma client (`temp/task management/prisma/client.ts`). Also added `temp/task management/package.json` with Prisma scripts (generate, migrate, studio). These are intended for the temp dev workspace — to activate them set DATABASE_URL and run `npm install` then `npm run prisma:migrate` in the `temp/task management` folder.
- 2025-09-17: Added unit test scaffolding using Vitest + React Testing Library under `temp/task management/tests`. Files added: `vitest.config.ts`, `tests/test-setup.ts`, `tests/TaskCard.test.tsx`, `tests/TaskListView.test.tsx`, and a local `tsconfig.json`. Updated `temp/task management/package.json` to include a `test` script and devDependencies for Vitest and testing libraries. These tests are lightweight smoke tests for components and are intended as a starting point; run them locally with `npm install` then `npm test` in `temp/task management`.
- 2025-09-17: Created Netlify deploy configuration (`temp/task management/netlify.toml`) and documented deployment steps and required environment variables in `temp/task management/netlify-readme.md`. The config uses `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` and sets the build command to run in `next-app`. Important env vars to set in Netlify: DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE, SENDGRID_API_KEY. Note: server-side DB access requires DATABASE_URL at runtime.
- 2025-09-18: Added unit tests scaffold and finalized documentation.
- 2025-09-19: Implemented providers, advanced hooks, and API subroutes for assign/status/comments/bulk. Added analytics API/hook and basic analytics UI. Added basic styles folder.
- 2025-09-19: Project paused — updated TODO with remaining tasks. To resume, set DATABASE_URL and other env vars, run Prisma migrations, and continue with the Remaining work checklist.

- 2025-09-13: Implemented analytics charts in `temp/task management/components/analytics/TaskAnalytics.tsx` using react-chartjs-2 (Doughnut for status, Bar for priority); wired to `useTaskAnalytics`. Added graceful empty-state handling.
- 2025-09-20: Implemented export, templates, and notifications features:
  - Added CSV export API `temp/task management/api/admin/tasks/export/route.ts` (supports format=csv|xlsx, basic filters),
  - Added file-backed templates API `temp/task management/api/admin/tasks/templates/route.ts`, and notifications API `temp/task management/api/admin/tasks/notifications/route.ts` (file-backed in `temp/task management/data/`),
  - Added UI panel `temp/task management/components/export/ExportPanel.tsx` and wired into DevTaskManagement.
  Note: Templates/notifications are file-backed to avoid requiring immediate Prisma migrations; to persist in DB, add a Template model and run migrations using existing DATABASE_URL.
- 2025-09-20: Implemented TaskForm validation with Zod and react-hook-form at `temp/task management/components/forms/TaskForm.tsx` and added schema at `temp/task management/schemas/task.ts`. Added unit test `temp/task management/tests/TaskForm.test.tsx` (Vitest + RTL) to cover validation and save flow.
- 2025-09-21: Implemented TaskProvider with optimistic updates and SSE-based real-time sync.
  - Added broadcaster `temp/task management/lib/realtime.ts` (in-process subscribers) and SSE endpoint `temp/task management/api/admin/tasks/stream/route.ts`.
  - Task CRUD routes now broadcast events on create/update/delete.
  - Added `temp/task management/providers/TaskProvider.tsx` implementing optimistic create/update/delete and EventSource listener.
  - Wired provider into `temp/task management/dev-task-management.tsx` and switched UI to use provider-backed tasks.
- 2025-09-22: Implemented `useTaskPermissions` hook to expose role-based permissions and wired role checks into the UI.
  - Added `temp/task management/hooks/useTaskPermissions.tsx` (reads NextAuth session role).
  - Dev UI now disables/hides create/delete/status-change actions when the current role lacks permissions.
  - Permission model: ADMIN(full), STAFF(create/edit/assign/comment), USER(comment-only).
- 2025-09-23: Implemented bulk UI flows:
  - Added `temp/task management/components/bulk/BulkActionsPanel.tsx` with delete/assign/mark-complete actions.
  - Wired selection state into `DevTaskManagement` and toggled selection via TaskCard click.
  - Bulk actions call `POST /api/admin/tasks/bulk` and show confirm dialogs; operations respect `useTaskPermissions.canBulk`.
- 2025-09-24: Implemented comments UI and API integration:
  - Added `temp/task management/api/admin/tasks/[id]/comments/route.ts` to GET and POST comments stored in Task.comments (JSON).
  - Added `temp/task management/components/comments/CommentsPanel.tsx` with threaded display, reply prompt, and attachments (file -> dataURL stored in JSON). Optimistic UI on post.
  - Wired task view dialog in `temp/task management/dev-task-management.tsx` to show task details and comments panel.
  Note: Attachments are stored as data URLs inside task.comments JSON for the dev workspace. For production, migrate attachments to object storage and store references in DB.
  Files changed/added are listed in the repository but key paths are: `temp/task management/*` modules, `src/lib/api.ts`, and new test & prisma files under temp. To finish full production readiness you must set env vars (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, SENDGRID_API_KEY) and connect a DB MCP (Neon/Prisma Postgres) via [Open MCP popover](#open-mcp-popover).
