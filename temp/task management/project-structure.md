## Development Log
- 2025-09-13: Initialized development documentation and TODO tracker at docs/project-structure.md. Verified available task module directory at `temp/task management/` (note the space). Awaiting confirmation to proceed using this path. Next: set workflow to keep all task-system work under temp/task management and begin initialization in dev mode.
- 2025-09-13: Relocated docs/project-structure.md to temp/task management/project-structure.md to keep the task system confined to the dev workspace. Next: initialize dev workspace in this directory per TODOs.
