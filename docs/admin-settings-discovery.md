## RBAC Source of Truth

- File: src/lib/permissions.ts
- Present keys include booking settings, services, analytics, team, users, etc.

### Missing permission keys for new settings categories
Add these to PERMISSIONS and ROLE_PERMISSIONS as appropriate:

- Organization Settings: ORG_SETTINGS_VIEW, ORG_SETTINGS_EDIT, ORG_SETTINGS_EXPORT (optional)
- Financial Settings: FIN_SETTINGS_VIEW, FIN_SETTINGS_EDIT, FIN_SETTINGS_EXPORT
- Integration Hub: INTEGRATIONS_SETTINGS_VIEW, INTEGRATIONS_SETTINGS_EDIT, INTEGRATIONS_SETTINGS_TEST
- Security & Compliance: SEC_SETTINGS_VIEW, SEC_SETTINGS_EDIT
- Communication: COMMS_SETTINGS_VIEW, COMMS_SETTINGS_EDIT, COMMS_SETTINGS_TEST
- Analytics & Reporting: AR_SETTINGS_VIEW, AR_SETTINGS_EDIT, AR_SETTINGS_EXPORT
- Client Management: CLIENT_SETTINGS_VIEW, CLIENT_SETTINGS_EDIT
- Team Management: TEAM_SETTINGS_VIEW, TEAM_SETTINGS_EDIT
- Task & Workflow: TASK_SETTINGS_VIEW, TASK_SETTINGS_EDIT
- System Administration: SYS_SETTINGS_VIEW, SYS_SETTINGS_EDIT

For categories supporting import/export/reset, also define: *_IMPORT, *_EXPORT, *_RESET where applicable.

## Notes
- SettingsNavigation is already wired and should source from the registry.
- BookingSettingsPanel exists; extend with new tabs and sub-endpoints per plan.
- Organization settings API is present and functional; ensure Prisma migrations exist in deployment pipelines.
