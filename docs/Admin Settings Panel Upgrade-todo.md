## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Kickoff and repository scan
  - **Why**: Establish baseline, locate SettingsShell, navigation, and registry for search integration
  - **Impact**: Clear entry points identified (SettingsShell, SettingsNavigation, SETTINGS_REGISTRY) enabling Phase 1 search work

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Integrate Global Settings Search (Fuse.js) with category filters into SettingsShell header

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- Prisma schema changes will require migrations and env-DB coordination; defer until frontend search is stable
- Adding new dependency (fuse.js) requires install; ensure CI picks it up

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Add fuse.js dependency and build a search index hook over SETTINGS_REGISTRY
- [ ] Implement SettingsSearch component with Cmd/Ctrl+K focus and category filter
- [ ] Wire search UI into SettingsShell header and verify accessibility
- [ ] Append results and validation notes to this log
