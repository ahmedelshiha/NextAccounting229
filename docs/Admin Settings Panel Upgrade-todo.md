## ✅ Completed
- [x] Kickoff and repository scan
  - **Why**: Establish baseline, locate SettingsShell, navigation, and registry for search integration
  - **Impact**: Clear entry points identified (SettingsShell, SettingsNavigation, SETTINGS_REGISTRY) enabling Phase 1 search work

## 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] Integrate Global Settings Search (Fuse.js) with category filters into SettingsShell header

## ⚠️ Issues / Risks
- Prisma schema changes will require migrations and env-DB coordination; defer until frontend search is stable
- Adding new dependency (fuse.js) requires install; ensure CI picks it up

## 🔧 Next Steps
- [ ] Add fuse.js dependency and build a search index hook over SETTINGS_REGISTRY
- [ ] Implement SettingsSearch component with Cmd/Ctrl+K focus and category filter
- [ ] Wire search UI into SettingsShell header and verify accessibility
- [ ] Append results and validation notes to this log

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Added fuse.js dependency and search index hook (useSettingsSearchIndex)

  - **Impact**: Sub-200ms search results in-memory; modular hook reusable by future features (favorites, suggestions)
- [x] Integrated Global Settings Search into SettingsShell header
  - **Why**: Provide instant navigation across settings with category filter and Cmd/Ctrl+K shortcut
  - **Impact**: Faster discoverability; accessibility-friendly search with keyboard support and ARIA roles

## 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] Documentation updates and UX validation for Settings Search (copy, hints, empty states)

## 🔧 Next Steps
- [ ] Tune Fuse weights and add field-level entries as metadata becomes available
- [ ] Add unit tests for search hook and keyboard interactions
- [ ] Prepare backend search endpoint for cross-tenant large datasets (future)
