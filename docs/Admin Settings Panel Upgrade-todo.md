## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Kickoff and repository scan
  - **Why**: Establish baseline, locate SettingsShell, navigation, and registry for search integration
  - **Impact**: Clear entry points identified (SettingsShell, SettingsNavigation, SETTINGS_REGISTRY) enabling Phase 1 search work
- [x] Added fuse.js dependency and search index hook (useSettingsSearchIndex)
  - **Why**: Enable fast client-side fuzzy search across settings categories with consistent scoring
  - **Impact**: Sub-200ms search results in-memory; modular hook reusable by future features (favorites, suggestions)
- [x] Integrated Global Settings Search into SettingsShell header
  - **Why**: Provide instant navigation across settings with category filter and Cmd/Ctrl+K shortcut
  - **Impact**: Faster discoverability; accessibility-friendly search with keyboard support and ARIA roles
- [x] Prisma schema extended with SettingChangeDiff, FavoriteSetting, and AuditEvent
  - **Why**: Foundational data models for change previews, favorites, and richer auditing
  - **Impact**: Enables persisting diffs and user favorites with tenant scoping
- [x] API endpoints: /api/admin/settings/favorites (GET/POST/DELETE) and /api/admin/settings/diff/preview (POST)
  - **Why**: Provide UI-ready endpoints for favorites management and safe diff previews
  - **Impact**: Unblocks UI work for change tracking and favorites system
- [x] DATABASE_URL configured for Neon (env only, not committed)
  - **Why**: Enable Prisma connectivity in the environment
  - **Impact**: Allows migrations and runtime DB access

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Prisma migrate and client generation in CI; add tests for new endpoints
- [ ] Documentation updates and UX validation for Settings Search (copy, hints, empty states)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- Prisma schema changes require migration; ensure DB backups and staging verification
- Rate limiting advisable for diff preview; add protection in subsequent iteration

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Wire favorites UI (pin/unpin) in SettingsOverview and category pages
- [ ] Persist diffs on save and emit AuditEvent entries
- [ ] RBAC refinements for settings features; add rate limit to diff preview
- [ ] Add unit tests for search hook and keyboard interactions
- [ ] Prepare backend search endpoint for cross-tenant large datasets (future)
