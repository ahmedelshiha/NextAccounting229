2025-09-21  â€” AvailabilitySlot persistence & admin UI implemented

Summary:
- Added admin API endpoints to manage AvailabilitySlot records: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE at /api/admin/availability-slots.
- Integrated AvailabilitySlot handling into availability engine: blocked or full slots are considered busy windows when generating availability.
- Created a simple admin UI at /admin/availability to list, create and delete slots (src/components/admin/AvailabilitySlotsManager.tsx).

Why:
- Allows administrators to create manual overrides, blockouts and capacity-limited slots (holidays, maintenance, capacity adjustments).
- Ensures frontend availability respects admin-managed exceptions and avoids overbooking slots that are full.

Files changed/added:
- src/app/api/admin/availability-slots/route.ts (NEW)
- src/lib/booking/availability.ts (UPDATED)
- src/components/admin/AvailabilitySlotsManager.tsx (NEW)
- src/app/admin/availability/page.tsx (NEW)
- docs/service-portal-TODO.md (UPDATED)

Next steps:
- Extend conflict detection to incorporate explicit AvailabilitySlot reservations and team-member capacity rules.
- Add edit/update UI for availability slots and audit logging on changes.
- Add unit tests for the new API and availability behavior.
