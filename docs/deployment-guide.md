# 2. Generate Prisma client
pnpm db:generate

# 3. Run linting
pnpm lint

# 4. Type checking
pnpm typecheck

```

#### **Deployment Steps**
1. **Merge Pull Request**: `feature/dashboard-layout-redesign`
2. **Deploy to Production**: Push to main branch
3. **Database Migration**: Run any pending migrations

## üìä **Performance Monitoring Setup**

### **Built-in Performance Tracking**

The admin dashboard includes automatic performance monitoring via the `usePerformanceMonitoring` hook:

```typescript
// Automatic tracking includes:
- Component render times
- Navigation performance
- User interaction patterns
- Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Bundle load performance
- Error rates and types
```

### **Production Analytics Configuration**

#### **Google Analytics Integration**
If using Google Analytics, add to your production environment:

```bash
# Environment variable
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

The performance monitoring hook will automatically send admin-specific events:

```javascript
// Events tracked:
- admin_performance: Component performance metrics
- admin_navigation: Route transition times
- admin_interaction: User clicks, scrolls, form submissions
- admin_error: Error tracking and recovery
```

#### **Custom Analytics Dashboard**
Create a monitoring dashboard to track:
- **User Engagement**: Session duration, page views, bounce rate
- **Performance Metrics**: Load times, bundle sizes, error rates
- **Feature Usage**: Navigation patterns, most-used admin features
- **Technical Health**: Component render times, API response times
