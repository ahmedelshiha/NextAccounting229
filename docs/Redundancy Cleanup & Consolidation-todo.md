## ‚úÖ Completed (append)
- [x] Standardized session retrieval in api-wrapper to use getSessionOrBypass from '@/lib/auth'
  - **Why**: unifies session logic so tests can mock a single module (`@/lib/auth`) instead of both `next-auth` and `next-auth/next`.
  - **Impact**: reduces mocking inconsistencies; simplifies tenant-context behavior during tests.

## üîß Next verification step
- Run a focused subset of tenant-related tests to validate behavior: tests/integration/tenant-mismatch.security.test.ts and related suites.
- If tests still fail due to missing mocks, update test helpers to mock '@/lib/auth' instead of 'next-auth'.

## üìã Full Test Run Notes
- The full test run was attempted; it produced dozens of failing tests across auth/session mocks, tenant context, and UI render helpers. The failures cluster around:
  - Auth/session mocking surface mismatches (getSessionOrBypass vs next-auth mocks)
  - Tenant context propagation (AsyncLocalStorage) and tenant cookie validation
  - Permission checks and RBAC expectations in API routes
  - Testing-library DOM helpers not present or mocked incorrectly in vitest.setup

## üîÅ Next actions (I will perform these if you confirm)
- [ ] Create granular TODOs for each failing test file with owner and estimated effort (I can create these here).
- [ ] Start triage on highest-priority failures (auth/session mocks, tenant-context) and apply fixes incrementally.
- [ ] Stabilize test environment (ensure vitest.setup.ts provides consistent mocks for auth, permissions, testing-library)
- [ ] Re-run full test suite after fixes and iterate until green.

---
*I attempted to run the full suite; the run produced extensive failure output which has been summarized above and appended to this todo file. If you want me to start fixing items, confirm which priority you prefer (auth/tenant first is recommended)."
