## ‚úÖ Completed (append)
- [x] Began triage for tenant/context-related test failures
  - **What I ran**: focused test runs and logs after setting DATABASE_URL
  - **Key failing tests observed (representative):**
    - tests/integration/tenant-mismatch.security.test.ts (tenant cookie & header mismatch scenarios)
    - tests/integration/tenant-mismatch.portal.security.test.ts (portal tenant cookie validation)
    - tests/admin-services.route.test.ts (admin services APIs returning 500/403)
    - tests/booking-settings.service.test.ts & tests/booking-settings.api.test.ts (booking settings creation/scoping failures)
    - tests/integration/prisma-tenant-guard.test.ts (tenant scoping middleware failures)
  - **Immediate errors/log excerpts:**
    - Invalid tenant cookie signature { userId: 'test-user', tenantId: undefined }
    - Prisma query built with tenantId: "undefined" causing query errors
    - Mocking errors in tests: missing exports on mocked modules (e.g., PERMISSIONS on '@/lib/permissions', applyRateLimit on '@/lib/rate-limit')

## üîç Root cause analysis (preliminary)
- Inconsistent or missing tenantId in mocked sessions: some test mocks return session.user without tenantId which leads to tenantContext receiving undefined and downstream code building queries with tenantId="undefined".
- Tenant cookie verification previously passed String(user.tenantId) even when undefined; this resulted in invalid signatures and confusing logs. I added a defensive check to return 403 when tenant cookie exists but the session user lacks tenantId.
- Test-suite mocking inconsistencies: tests sometimes mock 'next-auth' but not 'next-auth/next' or vice versa. Code imports getServerSession from 'next-auth/next' in some places and from 'next-auth' in others ‚Äî this can cause mocks to miss the intended target.
- Some tests rely on partial module mocks but the module mocks in test files do not provide all exports expected by consumers, leading to RENDER_ERRORs during test rendering.

## ‚úÖ Changes applied during triage
- Added defensive tenant cookie validation in src/lib/api-wrapper.ts to deny when session lacks tenantId and tenant_sig cookie is present.
- Re-ran targeted tests; observed reduced but still numerous failures due to broader mocking and integration issues.

## üîß Recommended fixes / next actions (pick one to proceed)
1) Standardize session retrieval in api-wrapper: import and call getSessionOrBypass() from '@/lib/auth' (centralized) to reduce mocking inconsistency ‚Äî then update tests/mocks accordingly.
2) Harden test mocks: update test helpers to consistently mock both 'next-auth' and 'next-auth/next' or prefer mocking '@/lib/auth' and getSessionOrBypass.
3) Triage and fix failing integration tests focused on tenant injection (prisma-tenant-guard): inspect tenant middleware/util functions (src/lib/tenant, tenant-utils) to ensure they handle missing tenantId gracefully and fail fast with clear errors.
4) Fix missing exports in some module mocks (tests that expect PERMISSIONS, applyRateLimit) ‚Äî update tests to importActual or provide full mock exports.
5) Re-run failing tests one-by-one and fix regressions introduced during earlier refactors (hook consolidation etc.).

## üîÑ Next recommended immediate step (I can run now)
- Implement option (1): refactor src/lib/api-wrapper.ts to use getSessionOrBypass from '@/lib/auth' for session retrieval; run a focused subset of tenant-related tests again.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Running the full test-suite is time-consuming; I'll continue with focused failures first.
- The DATABASE_URL provided is in environment; ensure credential rotation after tests if it's a real secret.

Append-only log updated.
