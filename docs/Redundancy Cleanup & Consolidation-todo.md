## ✅ Completed (append)
- [x] Ran pnpm typecheck and pnpm test to validate refactor
  - **Outcome**: Test run timed out and revealed multiple failing tests and environment issues.
  - **Key failures / blockers (partial output):**
    - Multiple UI tests failed due to DOM/test environment issues (screen.getByRole is not a function)
    - Several booking-settings and booking-settings.api tests failing (missing tenant context, booking settings not found)
    - Integration tests report: Database is not configured. Set NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL or DATABASE_URL to enable DB features.
    - Prisma tenant-guard integration tests failing (tenant injection/scoping mismatches)
  - **Impact**: Cannot verify refactor safety until tests pass; some failures are environmental (DB envs), others may be regressions needing investigation

## ✅ Completed (append)
- [x] Set DATABASE_URL for test runs (value provided by admin) — value redacted in logs
  - **Why**: enable integration tests that require a Postgres database
  - **Impact**: test runner executed against real DB; many integration failures surfaced (see In Progress below)

## 🔧 Recommended next steps
- [ ] Re-run full typecheck and tests now that DATABASE_URL is set
- [ ] Triage failing tests focusing on tenant/context issues and API permission mismatches
- [ ] Add CI mocks or test fixtures to avoid brittle integration failures in CI

## 🔄 In Progress
- [ ] Running full test-suite after DATABASE_URL provision (partial run timed out; see console output for failures)

## ⚠️ Issues / Risks
- The DATABASE_URL was set from a user-provided string. Ensure secrets are rotated if this is a production credential.
- Some failures may be regressions introduced during consolidation and require focused fixes.
