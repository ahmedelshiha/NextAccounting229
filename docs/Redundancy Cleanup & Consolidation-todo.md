## âœ… Actions taken
- [x] Removed static import of getSessionOrBypass from src/lib/api-wrapper.ts to avoid static resolution issues with test mocks. Now auth helpers are dynamically imported at runtime, making tests that vi.mock('@/lib/auth') or vi.mock('next-auth') work consistently.

## ðŸ”§ Next verification
- Re-run tenant/context focused tests: tests/integration/tenant-mismatch.security.test.ts
- If additional failures due to mocks persist, adapt vitest.setup.ts to provide comprehensive default mocks.

## âœ… Completed
- [x] Fix thresholds unauthenticated path returning 200 instead of 401
  - **Why**: test/build failure; withTenantContext preferred next-auth root mock over next-auth/next, so tests couldn't force unauth
  - **Impact**: Builds unblock; route auth now respects per-test overrides, ensuring correct 401 behavior when unauthenticated
- [x] Consolidate cron reminders to shared scheduler
  - **Why**: Remove duplicate reminder logic between lib/cron.ts and lib/cron/reminders.ts
  - **Impact**: Netlify function and API routes now share identical logic via processBookingReminders; reduced drift and easier maintenance (src/lib/cron.ts delegates; /api/cron uses scheduler)

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Unify redundant routes and preview-login logic

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate hooks (usePerformanceMonitoring) and SettingsNavigation into shared modules
- [ ] Extract remaining cron tasks into a single scheduler module or delegate wrappers
- [ ] Standardize Prisma env to DATABASE_URL across deploy targets
- [ ] Add CI guardrails for duplicate routes/components
