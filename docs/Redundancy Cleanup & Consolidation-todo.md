## ‚úÖ Completed (append)
- [x] Standardized session retrieval in api-wrapper to use getSessionOrBypass from '@/lib/auth'
  - **Why**: unifies session logic so tests can mock a single module (`@/lib/auth`) instead of both `next-auth` and `next-auth/next`.
  - **Impact**: reduces mocking inconsistencies; simplifies tenant-context behavior during tests.

## üîß Next verification step
- Run a focused subset of tenant-related tests to validate behavior: tests/integration/tenant-mismatch.security.test.ts and related suites.
- If tests still fail due to missing mocks, update test helpers to mock '@/lib/auth' instead of 'next-auth'.

## üìã Plan to remediate
- Prioritize tenant/context and auth-related failures first (they block many other tests):
  1. Stabilize auth mocks (centralize to `@/lib/auth` and update vitest.setup.ts); ensure getSessionOrBypass is exported and mockable.
  2. Verify tenant cookie and tenantContext behavior under test mocks.
  3. Re-run failing integration tests and fix API wrapper edge-cases.

- Parallelizable items (UI tests, specific service logic) can be batched and fixed concurrently after auth/tenant stabilization.

## üîÅ Next actions (pick one)
- [ ] I will create individual TODOs for each test file above with an owner/estimate and start triaging the highest priority ones (tenant/auth).
- [ ] Or I can begin implementing the top-priority fixes now (auth mock stabilization + tenant cookie handling).
