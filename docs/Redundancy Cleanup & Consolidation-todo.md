## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] F1: Consolidated auth register routes; legacy /api/auth/register/register now redirects to canonical /api/auth/register
  - Why: remove duplicate route surface
  - Impact: single source of registration logic; legacy clients supported via 307 redirect
- [x] F2: Unified dev login to /api/_dev/login; /api/dev-login redirects
  - Why: prevent ambiguous dev entrypoints
  - Impact: safer gating; single path in tests and docs
- [x] F3: Extracted shared health module at src/lib/health.ts and refactored routes to use it
  - Why: avoid drift across health endpoints/functions
  - Impact: consistent health payloads
- [x] F4: De-duplicated usePerformanceMonitoring; only src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts remains
  - Why: remove import ambiguity
  - Impact: stable imports
- [x] F5: Consolidated SettingsNavigation to src/components/admin/settings/SettingsNavigation.tsx with barrel re-export at src/components/admin/SettingsNavigation.tsx
  - Why: avoid UI drift
  - Impact: single source, backward-compatible imports
- [x] F6: Fixed duplicate import in e2e/playwright.config.ts
  - Why: cleanup redundancy
  - Impact: cleaner config, no duplication warnings
- [x] F8: Standardized Prisma datasource to DATABASE_URL; prisma.config.ts mirrors NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL‚ÜíDATABASE_URL. Set DATABASE_URL from env.
  - Why: eliminate env drift
  - Impact: consistent DB connection locally and on Netlify/Vercel

## ‚úÖ Completed (2025-10-08)
- [x] Fix build parsing error in src/lib/api-wrapper.ts
  - Why: unblock Netlify build (ESLint parsing error: "catch or finally expected" at line ~70)
  - Impact: restored lint/typecheck/build pipeline; robust session resolution with fallbacks; added JSDoc

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- None observed for this change; wrapper preserves existing auth/tenant semantics.

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Review and unify redundant auth/register routes and preview-login logic

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Run lint/typecheck/tests to confirm no regressions
- [ ] Proceed with Objective 1: unify /auth/register, /api/auth/register and preview login
