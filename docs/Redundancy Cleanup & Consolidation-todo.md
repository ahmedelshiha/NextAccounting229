## âœ… Completed (append)
- [x] Ran pnpm typecheck and pnpm test to validate refactor
  - **Outcome**: Test run timed out and revealed multiple failing tests and environment issues.
  - **Key failures / blockers (partial output):**
    - Multiple UI tests failed due to DOM/test environment issues (screen.getByRole is not a function)
    - Several booking-settings and booking-settings.api tests failing (missing tenant context, booking settings not found)
    - Integration tests report: Database is not configured. Set NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL or DATABASE_URL to enable DB features.
    - Prisma tenant-guard integration tests failing (tenant injection/scoping mismatches)
  - **Impact**: Cannot verify refactor safety until tests pass; some failures are environmental (DB envs), others may be regressions needing investigation

## ðŸ”§ Recommended next steps
- [ ] Provide DB test database connection (set DATABASE_URL or NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL) for CI/local test runs or mock DB in tests
- [ ] Re-run full typecheck/tests after DB envs are available
- [ ] Triage failing unit tests to identify regressions introduced by hook consolidation (focus on tenant/context-related failures)

## ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Awaiting instruction to proceed with test-fix triage or provide DB credentials/environment for CI
