# Admin Booking — Progress Log

## 2025-09-23
- Work: Created and reorganized `docs/admin-booking-todo.md` with dependency-ordered, measurable tasks and checkboxes. Added status update (what/why/next).
- Why: Establish a clear, execution-ready plan to implement Booking Settings using Next.js, Prisma, and Netlify with RBAC and audit logging.
- Outcome: Team can proceed in a deterministic order (Prisma → Types → Service → API → RBAC → UI → Caching → Tests → QA → Deploy). Next action is Prisma models + migration.
