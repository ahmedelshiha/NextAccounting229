- Work: Implemented admin Booking Settings page at `src/app/admin/settings/booking/page.tsx`; added caching + invalidation to `BookingSettingsService`; verified Prisma models, API routes, RBAC, and UI panel are complete.
- Why: Ensure the module is accessible via admin UI and improve performance with cached reads while maintaining consistency via invalidation on mutations.
- Outcome: Booking Settings module is feature-complete and performant. Next: add automated tests (service/API/UI), run admin QA, verify Netlify envs/build.
