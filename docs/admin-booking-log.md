# Admin Booking — Progress Log

## 2025-09-23
- Work: Created and reorganized `docs/admin-booking-todo.md` with dependency-ordered, measurable tasks and checkboxes. Added status update (what/why/next).
- Why: Establish a clear, execution-ready plan to implement Booking Settings using Next.js, Prisma, and Netlify with RBAC and audit logging.
- Outcome: Team can proceed in a deterministic order (Prisma → Types → Service → API → RBAC → UI → Caching → Tests → QA → Deploy). Next action is Prisma models + migration.

## 2025-09-23 (cont.)
- Work: Implemented admin Booking Settings page at `src/app/admin/settings/booking/page.tsx`; added caching + invalidation to `BookingSettingsService`; verified Prisma models, API routes, RBAC, and UI panel are complete.
- Why: Ensure the module is accessible via admin UI and improve performance with cached reads while maintaining consistency via invalidation on mutations.
- Outcome: Booking Settings module is feature-complete and performant. Next: add automated tests (service/API/UI), run admin QA, verify Netlify envs/build.

## 2025-09-23 (tests)
- Work: Added service tests (`tests/booking-settings.service.test.ts`) and API tests (`tests/booking-settings.api.test.ts`, `tests/booking-settings.api-auth.test.ts`). Added static UI render test (`tests/booking-settings.panel.render.test.tsx`).
- Why: Ensure correctness and RBAC enforcement; begin UI coverage.
- Outcome: Service + API coverage complete; UI static render covered. Interactive UI tests limited by current static renderer.

## 2025-09-23 (ops)
- Work: Verified `netlify.toml` build steps and Next.js plugin configuration; added Admin QA checklist to `docs/admin-booking-todo.md` and documented required Netlify environment variables.
- Why: Ensure smooth production deploys and structured QA before release.
- Outcome: Ready for final Admin QA and Netlify env configuration; deployment steps clear.
