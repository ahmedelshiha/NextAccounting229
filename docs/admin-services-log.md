## [Init] Admin Services Foundations
- Implemented types, schemas, utils, hooks
- Added ServicesService business layer and admin APIs (list, CRUD, bulk, stats, export)
- Extended RBAC with services.* permissions
- Rationale: provide secure, typed, extensible backbone for upcoming UI enhancements

## [2025-09-21] Foundations & Core Components
What I implemented:
- Types & validation: src/types/services.ts, src/schemas/services.ts
- Utilities: src/lib/services/utils.ts (slug, sanitize, filter/sort, analytics helpers)
- Hooks: src/hooks/useDebounce.ts, src/hooks/useServicesPermissions.ts, src/hooks/useServicesData.ts
- Cache & notifications (safe no-op implementations): src/lib/cache.service.ts, src/lib/notification.service.ts
- Business layer: src/services/services.service.ts (Prisma-based, multi-tenant aware, caching hooks)
- Admin APIs: src/app/api/admin/services/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/services/[id]/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/services/bulk/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/services/stats/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/services/export/route.ts
- UI components (core): src/components/admin/services/ServicesHeader.tsx, ServicesFilters.tsx, ServiceCard.tsx, ServiceForm.tsx, BulkActionsPanel.tsx
- Permissions: extended src/lib/permissions.ts to add SERVICES_* and updated role mappings

Why:
- Provide a production-ready, secure, and extensible admin services module with strong validation and RBAC.
- Create clear separation between business logic (ServicesService) and UI, enabling thorough testing and reuse.
- Keep safe fallbacks for environments without an attached DB so the app remains functional in demos.

Next steps:
- Implement ServicesAnalytics UI and wire charting to /api/admin/services/stats
- Migrate existing admin/services page to use new components incrementally
- Add unit and integration tests for utilities, business logic, and APIs
- Perform a full typecheck, lint pass, and run a Netlify preview deploy

Notes:
- All changes are implemented as standalone, reusable modules and keep existing styles/breakpoints.
- If you want, I can continue and implement ServicesAnalytics and complete the migration now.
