## [2025-09-21] ServicesAnalytics implemented
What I implemented:
- ServicesAnalytics component: src/components/admin/services/ServicesAnalytics.tsx
  - KPIs: total bookings, revenue, conversion rate, avg booking value
  - Sections: Most popular services, Revenue by service, Monthly bookings trend (visual bars)
  - Loading and unavailable states handled

Why:
- Provide analytics UI so admins can quickly monitor service performance and support data-driven decisions.

Next steps:
- Wire live data from GET /api/admin/services/stats into the admin page rendering this component.
- Add lightweight unit tests for data aggregation functions and component rendering.
- Consider adding Chart.js or a lightweight charting lib for improved visuals if required.
