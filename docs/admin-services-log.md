## [2025-09-24] Phase 2 – Completion
What I changed:
- Added `views` counter to `Service` model in prisma/schema.prisma and updated public service GET route to increment views on each fetch.
- Enhanced analytics to compute conversions from views→bookings per top services and included revenueTimeSeries, monthlyBookings, revenueByService, and popularServices in `ServicesService.getServiceStats`.
- Updated service APIs to use `status = 'ACTIVE'` for public lookups and ensured tenant scoping across analytics queries.
- Extended BulkAction schema and service layer to support `clone` and `settings-update` with per-item results and rollback for clones.

Why:
- Complete Phase 2 by ensuring the data model, service layer, and analytics are aligned to support richer admin features and reliable deployment migrations.

Next steps:
- Add per-month view tracking for improved conversion accuracy (introduce service_views table or use analytics provider).
- Surface analytics (revenueTimeSeries & conversionsByService) in admin UI and add unit/integration tests to validate analytics math.
