## [2025-09-21] Admin Services plan restructured
What I did:
- Reorganized admin services TODO into an actionable, dependency-ordered checklist with acceptance criteria and deployment gates.

Why:
- Clarifies scope, reduces risk, enables parallelization, and ensures deploy readiness.

Next:
- Begin wiring admin services page layout and data flow, then modals and bulk actions, followed by tests and deployment checks.
