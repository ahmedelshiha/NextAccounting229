## [Init] Admin Services Foundations
- Implemented types, schemas, utils, hooks
- Added ServicesService business layer and admin APIs (list, CRUD, bulk, stats, export)
- Extended RBAC with services.* permissions
- Rationale: provide secure, typed, extensible backbone for upcoming UI enhancements
- Notes: docs/docs/admin-services-log.md path does not exist; using docs/admin-services-log.md instead.
