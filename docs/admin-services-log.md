## [2025-09-21] Wired admin services UI and accessibility improvements
What I implemented:
- Integrated ServicesHeader, ServicesFilters, ServiceCard, ServiceForm, BulkActionsPanel, and ServicesAnalytics into the admin services page (src/app/admin/services/page.tsx).
- Replaced the inline admin page implementation with a component-driven layout and added client-side pagination and filtering.
- Implemented an accessible modal component (src/components/ui/Modal.tsx) and migrated the create/edit ServiceForm into modal flows.
- Integrated focus-trap-react to ensure robust focus management and click/Escape deactivation.
- Added unit tests for services utilities and Zod schemas (tests/services/utils.test.ts, tests/services/schemas.test.ts).
- Updated documentation and TODOs (docs/admin-services-todo.md, docs/service-portal-TODO.md).

Why:
- Move admin services to a maintainable, testable component architecture and improve accessibility of critical admin workflows.
- Provide a clear testing scaffold and actionable next steps for integration and component tests.

Next steps:
- Run pnpm install locally to install new dependency (focus-trap-react), then run lint, typecheck and tests.
- Add component tests for modal behavior and services page flows; add integration tests for the admin services APIs.
- Finalize Netlify preview deploy and smoke tests.
