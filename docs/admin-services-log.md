## [2025-09-22] Phase 1.2 – UI Component Consolidation completed
What I changed:
- Replaced custom header/controls in `@/app/admin/services/page.tsx` with `ServicesHeader`.
- Integrated `ServicesFilters` into the Advanced Filters area; delegated category/status/featured to shared component.
- Replaced ad-hoc analytics tab content with `ServicesAnalytics` wired to `/api/admin/services/stats` data.
- Preserved local sort controls and bulk actions; kept view mode toggle.

Why:
- Remove duplication, improve consistency, and centralize UX patterns for maintainability.

Next steps:
- Phase 1.3 – consolidate validation: migrate URL checks to Zod and keep `sanitizeServiceData` transform-only.
