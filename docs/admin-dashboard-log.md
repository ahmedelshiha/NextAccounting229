# Admin Dashboard â€“ Work Log

## 2025-09-23
- Completed Phase 0 (prep) and Phase 1 (inventory & reuse) by reviewing specs and the existing admin module audit.
- Rationale: Establish shared architecture, confirm Tailwind v4 and shadcn UI availability, and map reuse to minimize new surface area.
- Next: Implement Phase 3 types (src/types/dashboard.ts), then scaffold layout primitives (Sidebar, Topbar, PageHeader, DashboardLayout), followed by tabs, filters, and table components. Wire into src/app/admin/page.tsx.

## 2025-09-23 (cont.)
- Implemented dashboard type system (src/types/dashboard.ts).
- Verified and aligned core layout/navigation components under src/components/dashboard/* (Sidebar, Topbar, PageHeader, PrimaryTabs, SecondaryTabs, FilterBar, DataTable, DashboardLayout).
- Wrapped src/app/admin/page.tsx with DashboardLayout, preserving existing UI while standardizing the shell.
- Wired PrimaryTabs and FilterBar into admin dashboard with DataTable views for Bookings and Clients; added date/status filtering and formatting.

## 2025-09-23 (later)
- Extracted Sidebar navigation to a reusable config (src/components/dashboard/nav.config.ts). Added ARIA (aria-expanded, aria-current). Added redirects for missing routes.

## 2025-09-23 (final)
- A11y: Added keyboard navigation/ARIA to tabs, Topbar menus, Sidebar, and FilterBar labels.

## 2025-09-23 (bookings wiring)
- Implemented BookingsList wired to useBookings with FilterBar and DataTable (src/components/dashboard/lists/BookingsList.tsx) and demo page at /admin/service-requests/list.

## 2025-09-23 (bookings alignment + batch)
- Aligned columns with Prisma ServiceRequest/Booking: added ID, Client, Service, Status, Payment (status+amount from paymentAmountCents or service.price), Date (scheduledAt/createdAt fallback). Implemented batch actions: export (filters), cancel (bulk /api/admin/service-requests/bulk), assign (loop /[id]/assign). Selection-aware toolbar appears when items selected.
- Next: replicate pattern for Clients, Services, Tasks; finalize columns per Prisma; add tests and ensure types.
