# Admin Dashboard – Work Log

## 2025-09-23 – Ordered plan & docs update
- Reordered remaining dashboard tasks into a dependency-first, checkbox-based execution plan covering Clients, Services, Tasks, A11y/i18n, Performance/Quality, and Docs/Handoff.
- Added explicit acceptance criteria per task to ensure measurable outcomes.
- Updated docs/admin-dashboard-todo.md with a “Ordered Work Plan (Next Steps)” section and a documentation update block (what/why/next).
- Current status: Bookings list pattern complete; proceeding with Clients/Services/Tasks lists and aria-live/i18n.

## 2025-09-24 – Lists for Clients, Services, Tasks
- Implemented ClientsList, ServicesList, TasksList as reusable, SWR-driven list modules reusing FilterBar and DataTable.
- Added host routes: /admin/users/list, /admin/services/list, /admin/tasks/list.
- Batch actions wired: users role/status (PATCH loop), services activate/deactivate (POST /api/admin/services/bulk), tasks status updates (POST /api/admin/tasks/bulk).
- CSV export added for Services (/api/admin/services/export) and Tasks (/api/admin/tasks/export); filters respected in query.
- Accessibility: aria-live regions announce active filter count and selection totals in each list view.
- Skeleton states: DataTable loading skeleton used to avoid layout shift across new lists.
- Next: localize new strings (en/ar/hi), memoize heavy cells, run lint/typecheck/tests and update docs accordingly.

## 2025-09-24 – i18n integration and memoization
- Localized dashboard UI strings across FilterBar, DataTable, and list modules (Clients/Services/Tasks) using src/app/locales (en/ar/hi) and TranslationProvider.
- Wrapped app with TranslationProvider; preserved visual styles and ARIA. Dynamic counts announced via aria-live now localized.
- Memoized filter configs and column definitions to reduce re-renders/heavy cell work.
- Updated docs/admin-dashboard-todo.md to mark i18n and memoization complete; next: run lint/typecheck/tests and validate docs examples.

## 2025-09-24 ��� Lint/Typecheck/Tests cleanup
- Fixed TS errors: corrected PrimaryTabs onChange handler in src/app/admin/page.tsx and removed duplicate ClientLayout import in src/app/layout.tsx.
- Resolved ESLint warning in DataTable by replacing side-effect-only ternary with explicit if/else.
- Ran pnpm lint (clean), pnpm typecheck (clean), pnpm test:thresholds (passed). Updated docs/admin-dashboard-todo.md to reflect completion.

## 2025-09-24 – IA verification
- Reviewed Sidebar/nav.config.ts to confirm grouped navigation and routes exist for Clients, Bookings, Accounting, Team, and System. No missing routes detected; icons finalized via lucide-react.
- Marked Phase 2 IA subtasks complete in docs/admin-dashboard-todo.md.

## 2025-09-24 – Docs sync
- Validated docs/dashboard-structure.md code blocks compile and align with current props; noted extension points for nav, filters, columns, and tabs.
- Marked Docs & Handoff items complete in docs/admin-dashboard-todo.md.

## 2025-09-25 – Portal security, SSE & preferences
- Hardened portal APIs: enforced tenant and owner checks across portal service-requests and bookings routes; added OPTIONS handlers to provide accurate Allow headers.
- Instrumented /api/portal/realtime to write CONNECT/DISCONNECT events to health logs for observability.
- Switched portal notification hook to /api/portal/realtime and updated RealtimeConnectionPanel to fallback to SSE when WebSocket fails.
- Implemented optimistic booking-preferences update on the client with rollback on server error.
- Added respond.methodNotAllowed helper to standardize 405 responses.
- Next: add unit tests for tenant guards, SSE connect/disconnect, and integration/E2E tests for offline chat and cancel/export flows.
