# Admin Dashboard â€“ Work Log

## 2025-09-23
- Completed Phase 0 (prep) and Phase 1 (inventory & reuse) by reviewing specs and the existing admin module audit.
- Rationale: Establish shared architecture, confirm Tailwind v4 and shadcn UI availability, and map reuse to minimize new surface area.
- Next: Implement Phase 3 types (src/types/dashboard.ts), then scaffold layout primitives (Sidebar, Topbar, PageHeader, DashboardLayout), followed by tabs, filters, and table components. Wire into src/app/admin/page.tsx.

## 2025-09-23 (cont.)
- Implemented dashboard type system (src/types/dashboard.ts).
- Verified and aligned core layout/navigation components under src/components/dashboard/* (Sidebar, Topbar, PageHeader, PrimaryTabs, SecondaryTabs, FilterBar, DataTable, DashboardLayout).
- Wrapped src/app/admin/page.tsx with DashboardLayout, preserving existing UI while standardizing the shell.
- Wired PrimaryTabs and FilterBar into admin dashboard with DataTable views for Bookings and Clients; added date/status filtering and formatting.
- Why: Delivers actionable list views consistent with new shell and aligns with TODO Phase 5 wiring.
- Next: A11y (ARIA/keyboard nav), integrate server-backed filters, and run lint/typecheck/tests.
