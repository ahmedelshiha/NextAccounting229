# Admin Dashboard â€“ Work Log

## 2025-09-23
- Completed Phase 0 (prep) and Phase 1 (inventory & reuse) by reviewing specs and the existing admin module audit.
- Rationale: Establish shared architecture, confirm Tailwind v4 and shadcn UI availability, and map reuse to minimize new surface area.
- Next: Implement Phase 3 types (src/types/dashboard.ts), then scaffold layout primitives (Sidebar, Topbar, PageHeader, DashboardLayout), followed by tabs, filters, and table components. Wire into src/app/admin/page.tsx.
