## 2025-09-27 â€“ Dashboard modularization: KPI Grid extraction
- Extracted ProfessionalKPIGrid into reusable component at src/components/dashboard/analytics/ProfessionalKPIGrid.tsx.
- Wired it into src/app/admin/page.tsx and passed only required stats props.
- Why: align with QuickBooks-style modular architecture; improve reuse and maintainability without changing visuals.
- Next: extract BusinessIntelligence and Activity components; align chart slots with spec; update docs accordingly.
