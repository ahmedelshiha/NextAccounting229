# Admin Dashboard – Work Log

## 2025-09-23
- Completed Phase 0 (prep) and Phase 1 (inventory & reuse) by reviewing specs and the existing admin module audit.
- Rationale: Establish shared architecture, confirm Tailwind v4 and shadcn UI availability, and map reuse to minimize new surface area.
- Next: Implement Phase 3 types (src/types/dashboard.ts), then scaffold layout primitives (Sidebar, Topbar, PageHeader, DashboardLayout), followed by tabs, filters, and table components. Wire into src/app/admin/page.tsx.

## 2025-09-23 (cont.)
- Implemented dashboard type system (src/types/dashboard.ts).
- Verified and aligned core layout/navigation components under src/components/dashboard/* (Sidebar, Topbar, PageHeader, PrimaryTabs, SecondaryTabs, FilterBar, DataTable, DashboardLayout).
- Wrapped src/app/admin/page.tsx with DashboardLayout, preserving existing UI while standardizing the shell.
- Wired PrimaryTabs and FilterBar into admin dashboard with DataTable views for Bookings and Clients; added date/status filtering and formatting.
- Why: Delivers actionable list views consistent with new shell and aligns with TODO Phase 5 wiring.
- Next: A11y (ARIA/keyboard nav), integrate server-backed filters, and run lint/typecheck/tests.

## 2025-09-23 (later)
- Extracted Sidebar navigation to a reusable config (src/components/dashboard/nav.config.ts). Updated Sidebar to consume the config and added minimal ARIA (aria-expanded, aria-current).
- Why: Decouple IA from UI, enable reuse across admin/portal, and simplify future route validation and icon updates.
- Next: Validate routes exist or add redirects/stubs; add keyboard navigation; wire tabs/filters to hooks; ensure DataTable columns align with Prisma models.

## 2025-09-23 (later+)
- Validated Sidebar routes and added redirects for missing pages to closest existing destinations (e.g., /admin/clients/invitations → /admin/users, accounting pages → /admin/analytics, roles/permissions → /admin/users, notifications/integrations → /admin/settings).
- Why: Prevent broken navigation while IA stabilizes; ensures users land on a functional page without 404s.
- Next: Keyboard navigation for Sidebar/Topbar and tabs; begin wiring filters to hooks.

## 2025-09-23 (final)
- Added keyboard navigation and ARIA roles/states: tablists (primary/secondary tabs) with Arrow/Home/End support; aria-selected/tabIndex management; Topbar menus now announce expanded state and close on Escape; Sidebar landmark/expanded/controls wiring; FilterBar inputs labeled.
- Why: Improve accessibility and usability to meet A11y goals in Phase 6.
- Next: Announce filter changes via aria-live and selection counts; proceed to wiring filters to hooks.
