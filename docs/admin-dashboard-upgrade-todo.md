Version: 1.0
Maintainer: Autonomous Senior Developer (AI)
Primary Log File: docs/Admin Settings Panel Upgrade-todo.md
Created: 2025-10-08

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Kickoff and repository scan
  - **Why**: Establish baseline, locate SettingsShell, navigation, and registry for search integration
  - **Impact**: Clear entry points identified (SettingsShell, SettingsNavigation, SETTINGS_REGISTRY) enabling Phase 1 search work
- [x] Added fuse.js dependency and search index hook (useSettingsSearchIndex)
  - **Why**: Enable fast client-side fuzzy search across settings categories with consistent scoring
  - **Impact**: Sub-200ms search results in-memory; modular hook reusable by future features (favorites, suggestions)
- [x] Integrated Global Settings Search into SettingsShell header
  - **Why**: Provide instant navigation across settings with category filter and Cmd/Ctrl+K shortcut
  - **Impact**: Faster discoverability; accessibility-friendly search with keyboard support and ARIA roles
- [x] Prisma schema extended with SettingChangeDiff, FavoriteSetting, and AuditEvent
  - **Why**: Foundational data models for change previews, favorites, and richer auditing
  - **Impact**: Enables persisting diffs and user favorites with tenant scoping
- [x] API endpoints: /api/admin/settings/favorites (GET/POST/DELETE) and /api/admin/settings/diff/preview (POST)
  - **Why**: Provide UI-ready endpoints for favorites management and safe diff previews
  - **Impact**: Unblocks UI work for change tracking and favorites system
- [x] DATABASE_URL configured for Neon (env only, not committed)
  - **Why**: Enable Prisma connectivity in the environment
  - **Impact**: Allows migrations and runtime DB access
- [x] Backfilled tenantId for existing ComplianceRecord, HealthLog, and Task rows via SQL migration; added FKs to Tenant(id)
  - **Why**: Unblock schema requirements without data loss
  - **Impact**: Tenant scoping enforced on legacy rows; future writes conform to multi-tenant model
- [x] Favorites UI wired in Settings Overview (dynamic list from API; manage button placeholder)
  - **Why**: Quick access to frequently used settings
  - **Impact**: Improves admin productivity; groundwork for per-page pinning with FavoriteToggle

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Prisma migrate and client generation in CI; add tests for new endpoints
- [ ] Documentation updates and UX validation for Settings Search (copy, hints, empty states)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- Prisma schema changes require migration; ensure DB backups and staging verification
- Rate limiting advisable for diff preview; add protection in subsequent iteration
- Detected wider drift (enum recreation, extra table `playing_with_neon`, uniqueness changes). Skipped destructive `db push` to avoid data loss. Plan dedicated migration in staging later.

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Add FavoriteToggle to individual settings pages headers
- [ ] Persist diffs on save and emit AuditEvent entries
- [ ] RBAC refinements for settings features; add rate limit to diff preview
- [ ] Add unit tests for search hook and keyboard interactions
- [ ] E2E tests for favorites add/remove and persistence across sessions
- [ ] Prepare backend search endpoint for cross-tenant large datasets (future)

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Added FavoriteToggle to settings headers (organization, booking, financial, communication, clients, team, tasks, services, analytics, integrations, security, system)
  - **Why**: Enable one-click pinning from context of each settings category
  - **Impact**: Faster access to frequently used areas; consistent UX via shared component

## üöß In Progress
- [x] Persist diffs on save for Organization Settings (org-settings)
  - Implemented SettingChangeDiff + AuditEvent on org-settings PUT; rollout plan to other settings endpoints
- [ ] Unit tests for favorites service and SettingsSearch keyboard interactions

## üîß Next Steps
- [x] Roll out diff persistence and AuditEvent emission to financial, communication, team, tasks, services, analytics, integrations, security, system, booking, and client settings endpoints
- [x] Add rate limiting to diff preview endpoint
- [x] Add FavoriteToggle initial pinned state hydration (optional)

### Diff Persistence Rollout
- Status: ‚úÖ Completed
- Date: 2025-10-12
- Changes: Added SettingChangeDiff and AuditEvent persistence to client-settings and booking-settings; verified other categories already persisted.
- Files Modified: src/app/api/admin/client-settings/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/booking-settings/route.ts
- Notes: Completed. Next: finalize tests and docs polish.

### Diff Preview Rate Limiting
- Status: ‚úÖ Completed
- Date: 2025-10-12
- Changes: Enforced per-tenant+user rate limit (10/min) on diff preview endpoint with Redis-backed fallback to memory.
- Files Modified: src/app/api/admin/settings/diff/preview/route.ts, src/lib/rate-limit.ts
- Notes: Uses getClientIp fallback when userId missing; returns 429 on exceed.

### FavoriteToggle Hydration
- Status: ‚úÖ Completed
- Date: 2025-10-12
- Changes: Hydrated initial pinned state from sessionStorage cache; added cache updates in favorites service and event-driven sync to avoid flicker.
- Files Modified: src/services/favorites.service.ts, src/components/admin/settings/FavoriteToggle.tsx
- Notes: Keeps styles unchanged; listens to favorites:updated for cross-component sync.

### Favorites & Search Tests
- Status: ‚úÖ Completed
- Date: 2025-10-12
- Changes: Added unit tests for favorites service (get/add/remove) and DOM tests for SettingsSearch keyboard interactions (Slash focus, Mod+K, arrow navigation, Enter).
- Files Added: tests/services/favorites.service.test.ts, tests/components/admin/settings-search.keyboard.dom.test.tsx
- Notes: Mocks useSettingsSearchIndex and next/navigation router; no UI changes.
