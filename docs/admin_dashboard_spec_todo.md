# Admin Dashboard Implementation Plan — Dependency-Ordered TODO

Scope: Implement the QuickBooks-inspired professional admin dashboard defined in docs/admin_dashboard_spec.md, aligning with existing code under src/app/admin/** and components/**. Each task is specific, measurable, and outcome-oriented, with verification steps.

## 0) Discovery, Alignment, and Technical Baseline
- [ ] Read and annotate docs/admin_dashboard_spec.md to extract all modules, UI patterns, and contracts
  - Acceptance: A shared outline (this file) reflects all sections of the spec; no gaps.
  - Verify: Cross-check each spec section appears as tasks below.
- [ ] Inventory current admin code and templates for reuse
  - Paths: src/app/admin/**, components/admin/**, components/dashboard/**, components/dashboard/templates/**
  - Acceptance: Table mapping “spec module → existing pages/components/templates/APIs” produced in docs/admin_dashboard_spec_mapping.md
  - Verify: At least one reference mapped for every module with relevant code or “none yet”.
- [ ] Establish performance and UX baseline
  - Metrics: LCP ≤ 2.5s desktop, ≤ 4.0s mobile; FCP ≤ 1.8s; ALL admin pages TTI ≤ 3.5s; route data p95 ≤ 250ms
  - Acceptance: Baseline report stored in monitoring/performance-baseline.json updated with current values
  - Verify: Run vitest and lightweight profiling; document results.
