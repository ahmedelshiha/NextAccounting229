# Tenant Context Implementation - Automated Task List

# ðŸ§  Tenant Context Tasks Memory

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- Created tests/helpers/tenant-context.ts
- Created tests/helpers/request.ts

- Added ETag and 304 handling to admin services GET
- Created docs/TENANT_CONTEXT.md
- Created docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
- Audited API routes for withTenantContext wrapping and tenant validation; verified most routes already wrapped and using requireTenantContext where appropriate

## ðŸš§ In Progress Tasks
- Audit all API routes to ensure withTenantContext wrapping and tenant validation

## ðŸ’¡ Next Suggestions / Ideas
- Review services for getTenantId() helper and tenant scoping; add where missing
- Update failing tests to use new helpers; migrate existing tests incrementally
- Implement admin service-clone duplicate-name 409 and status transition tests per plan
- Run full test suite; add 404-on-cross-tenant checks where needed
