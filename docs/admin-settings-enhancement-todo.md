# Admin Settings Enhancements

## Completed
- [x] Resolve build failure in Communication Settings page
  - What: Added missing local state for Import modal (showImport, importData) and wired Export/Import controls.
  - Why: Enhancement/refactor of existing page to match established pattern used in other settings pages (clients, team, tasks), and to fix TS2304 errors.
  - Scope: src/app/admin/settings/communication/page.tsx

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run full typecheck/build and address any additional TypeScript errors.
- [ ] Add smoke tests for Import modal open/close and JSON parsing success/failure paths.
- [ ] Manually verify /api/admin/communication-settings/export and /import endpoints end-to-end from the UI.
