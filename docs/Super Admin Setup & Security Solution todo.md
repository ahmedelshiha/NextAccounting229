## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Granted SUPER_ADMIN full permissions by mapping role to all PERMISSIONS in src/lib/permissions.ts.
  - **Why**: SUPER_ADMIN lacked RBAC entries causing admin pages (e.g., Security & Compliance) to deny access.
  - **Impact**: SUPER_ADMIN can access all admin settings and actions; UI gates now pass.
- [x] Made /api/users/me resilient without DB by returning session-context user when DB env is missing.
  - **Why**: Login redirect relied on this endpoint; in demo/no-DB it failed, sending users to portal.
  - **Impact**: After sign-in, SUPER_ADMIN/ADMIN reliably route to /admin; fixes ‚Äúnot loading‚Äù due to 401/redirect.

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor step-up prompts on Security & Compliance GET for SUPER_ADMIN; confirm tenant override or env flag behavior.
