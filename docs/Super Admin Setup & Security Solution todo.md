## üöß Super Admin Setup & Security Solution - Incremental Log

This file is the central state for all Super Admin setup and security work. Append-only style ‚Äî new entries are added to the bottom.

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Wired AdminAuditsPage to use /api/admin/audit-logs for SUPER_ADMIN; legacy activity endpoint remains for others.
  - **Why**: correct data source based on privileges
  - **Impact**: SUPER_ADMINs see full audit logs; others see activity view

- [x] Added IP policy block audit in middleware (action: security.ip.block) with graceful edge fallback.
  - **Why**: traceability of access denials
  - **Impact**: improved incident visibility

- [x] Shipped emergency scripts: scripts/admin-setup/reset-password.ts and scripts/admin-setup/disable-mfa.ts
  - **Why**: recovery procedures
  - **Impact**: rapid response for lockouts and MFA issues

- [x] Enforced super admin session IP binding with configurable toggle (SUPERADMIN_STRICT_IP_ENFORCEMENT).
  - **Why**: protects privileged sessions from network hijacking or replay
  - **Impact**: super admin sessions require consistent network origin before accessing admin surfaces

- [x] Added audit telemetry and logging for super admin IP mismatch enforcement.
  - **Why**: ensures forced reauthentication events are discoverable
  - **Impact**: incident responders can rapidly trace unauthorized network shifts

- [x] Enhanced admin IP allowlist to support CIDR ranges and wildcard entries (*) via src/lib/security/ip-allowlist.ts and middleware integration.
  - **Why**: allow secure office network ranges and reduce maintenance overhead.
  - **Impact**: flexible, stricter IP enforcement for /admin and /api/admin without breaking existing exact-match configs.

- [x] Implemented IPv6 CIDR support and tests in src/lib/security/ip-allowlist.ts and tests/security/ip-allowlist.test.ts
  - **Why**: support mixed IPv4/IPv6 deployments
  - **Impact**: consistent allowlist behavior across IP families

- [x] Implemented step-up MFA for SUPER_ADMIN on sensitive endpoint(s) and integrated tenant override.
  - **Files**: src/lib/security/step-up.ts, src/app/api/admin/audit-logs/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/permissions/*, src/app/api/admin/security-settings/route.ts
  - **Why**: protects high-risk operations with fresh proof-of-presence
  - **Impact**: API returns 401 with `x-step-up-required` header and supports OTP via `x-mfa-otp` header

- [x] Added Super Admin Controls UI (tenant-level overrides) and integrated into Security Settings page
  - **Files**: src/components/admin/settings/SuperAdminSecurityModal.tsx, src/app/admin/settings/security/page.tsx
  - **Settings exposed**: twoFactor.requiredForAdmins (tenant override), superAdmin.stepUpMfa, network.enableIpRestrictions, network.ipAllowlist, network.ipBlocklist, superAdmin.logAdminAccess, dataProtection.auditLogRetentionDays

- [x] Added API route to expose client IP and allowlist match for operator UI
  - **File**: src/app/api/tools/client-ip/route.ts
  - **Why**: client-side helper needs authoritative client IP and matched rule

- [x] Added Admin IP helper UI component
  - **File**: src/components/admin/settings/AdminIpHelper.tsx
  - **Why**: show current client IP, family, allowlist match and matched rule in Admin UI

- [x] Added unit tests for step-up MFA and tenant override behavior
  - **Files**: tests/security/step-up.test.ts, tests/admin-stepup.route.test.ts, tests/admin-security-settings.stepup.test.ts, tests/security/step-up-tenant-override.test.ts

- [x] Updated ENV docs and runbook describing SUPERADMIN_STEPUP_MFA precedence and operational guidance
  - **Files**: docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_REFERENCE.md, docs/runbooks/superadmin-stepup-runbook.md

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks

- Tenant-level step-up override currently resolves via security-settings.service.get(null) when called from generic helpers. This is deliberate to reduce coupling in the step-up helper; in future we may want to pass tenantId into helper functions to consult the exact tenant settings.
- Enabling strict IP enforcement or global step-up across tenants can cause lockouts; coordinate staged rollouts and communicate to SUPER_ADMIN users.
- OTP transport via headers must only be used over HTTPS and never logged.

## üöß In Progress / Recent Actions

- [x] Implement Admin IP helper UI and backend route (completed)
- [x] Add unit test for tenant-level step-up override (completed)

## üîß Next Steps (recommended and actionable)

- [x] Add audit event when `superAdmin.logAdminAccess` is toggled (more granular than current security-settings:update event). This produces a clear audit entry indicating who changed logging policy and previous/new value.
  - Owner: Security Engineer
  - Verification: new entry in audit logs with action `security.superadmin.logAdminAccess.toggled`
  - Files changed: src/services/security-settings.service.ts
  - Note: Service now emits `security.superadmin.logAdminAccess.toggled` with details { tenantId, previous, current } when toggled.

- [x] Make Super Admin Controls modal visibility explicit to SUPER_ADMIN users only (UI guard). Currently PermissionGate controls access to the Security Settings page; added an extra client-side guard so only SUPER_ADMINs can open the modal and superAdmin.* toggles are hidden for others.
  - Owner: Frontend
  - Verification: non-super admins cannot open the modal nor read tenant-level superAdmin fields
  - Files changed: src/app/admin/settings/security/page.tsx, src/components/admin/settings/SuperAdminSecurityModal.tsx

- [x] Add IPv6-focused unit tests for ip-allowlist edge cases (zone identifiers, compression, ::ffff: mapped addresses) and add tests for matched rule resolution.
  - Owner: Test maintainer
  - Verification: tests in tests/security/ip-allowlist.test.ts
  - Files changed: tests/security/ip-allowlist.test.ts

- [x] Add a server-side enforcement audit to log when `network.enableIpRestrictions` denies access to an admin route. Implemented tenant-aware policy resolution, matched-rule detection, and inclusion of tenantId in audit details.
  - Owner: Backend
  - Verification: audit entries `security.ip.block` include tenantId, userId, ip, policySource, and matchedRule
  - Files changed: src/app/middleware.ts

- [x] Add help text and contextual tooltips to the Super Admin Controls modal explaining env vs tenant precedence, and operational impact.
  - Owner: UX/Frontend
  - Verification: tooltips present and link to runbook
  - Files changed: src/components/admin/settings/SuperAdminSecurityModal.tsx

- [x] Consider making verifySuperAdminStepUp accept tenantId to consult that tenant's settings explicitly rather than the current `get(null)` fallback. Implemented: helper now accepts optional tenantId and route callers pass tenantId when available.
  - Owner: Backend
  - Verification: updated helper signature and route callers pass tenantId where available
  - Files changed: src/lib/security/step-up.ts, src/app/api/admin/security-settings/route.ts, src/app/api/admin/permissions/*, src/app/api/admin/audit-logs/route.ts

- [x] Add unit tests that call verifySuperAdminStepUp with tenantId to validate tenant-scoped behavior
  - Files: tests/security/step-up-tenantid.test.ts
  - Verification: tests cover tenant-level true/false behavior and env fallback

## ‚úÖ Completed (most recent)
- [x] Admin IP helper UI + API
- [x] Unit test for tenant-level step-up override

Append further entries here in chronological order when new work begins or completes.

## ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ Paused

- [ ] Paused: Remote DB connection and migration application ‚Äî waiting for ops approval/credentials.
  - **Why**: CI environment blocked external DB access from automation; local/ops run required to apply DB migration that adds `superAdmin` JSON column to `security_settings` and seed defaults.
  - **Impact**: Tenant-level superAdmin overrides cannot be persisted until migration/seed complete. Some API behaviors (tenant-level step-up MFA) will fall back to environment flag.

## üîú Next Task (owner: Ops/Backend)

- [ ] Apply schema migration and seed to add `superAdmin` to security_settings
  - **Steps**:
    1. Ensure DATABASE_URL points to target Neon DB (ops):
       export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
    2. Run migrations in the deployment environment or locally with access:
       - pnpm db:migrate  # (or: npx prisma migrate deploy)
    3. Regenerate Prisma client:
       - pnpm db:generate
    4. Run seed script to ensure defaults:
       - pnpm db:seed
    5. Verify column and values:
       - SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='security_settings';
       - SELECT superAdmin FROM public.security_settings LIMIT 5;
  - **Verification**: security_settings contains `superAdmin` JSON with keys `stepUpMfa` and `logAdminAccess`; tests for tenant override pass locally/CI.
  - **Risks/Notes**: Running migrations in production must be coordinated; backups recommended. If you want, I can prepare a PR with the migration and seed changes (already added) and instructions for ops to run.

## ‚úÖ Completed

- _No new completions in this update_

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks

- Current rate limiting relies on per-process token buckets when Redis is available, because synchronous callers cannot await the distributed backend. In multi-instance or serverless deployments this permits bypassing limits by rotating instances, weakening brute-force and abuse defenses.

## üöß In Progress

- [ ] Implement distributed rate limiting via Redis-backed async helper and update admin, portal, and auth endpoints to await the shared limiter so quotas apply cross-instance.

## üîß Next Steps

- [ ] Emit `security.ratelimit.block` audit entries (with tenantId, userId, key, ip) whenever a privileged route returns 429 due to rate limiting, enabling responders to trace abuse patterns.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Migrated remaining synchronous rate limiters to distributed applyRateLimit on admin users list, service request assign, and admin chat endpoints; added security.ratelimit.block audits on 429.
  - **Why**: security patch and consistency
  - **Impact**: cross-instance rate limiting and better abuse traceability

- [x] Fixed dev server startup by bypassing Doppler in dev command (npm run next-dev).
  - **Why**: restore local development environment
  - **Impact**: enabled continued implementation and testing

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Audit remaining endpoints to ensure applyRateLimit is used exclusively and all 429s emit security.ratelimit.block; migrate any stragglers.

---
## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Added `security.ratelimit.block` audit logging for admin newsletter list endpoint and auth password flows (forgot/reset) when rate limits trigger.
  - **Why**: improve visibility into abuse and throttling on privileged/admin-related surfaces
  - **Impact**: responders can trace 429s with IP and key context; no user-facing leakage

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Continue auditing endpoints using applyRateLimit to ensure all privileged/admin routes emit `security.ratelimit.block` on 429; portal/public routes to be reviewed with privacy considerations.

---
## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Added `security.ratelimit.block` audit logging for portal and public endpoints on 429:
  - portal chat POST, portal service-requests (create, update, export, comments), public service-requests create, analytics track
  - **Why**: comprehensive visibility into abuse across user-facing surfaces
  - **Impact**: consistent incident traceability; minimal PII, tenant-scoped when available

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Final sweep: verify all 429 paths for privileged and user-facing endpoints emit audits; document exclusions if any (e.g., extremely high-volume public endpoints if noise becomes an issue).

---
## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Emit `security.ratelimit.block` on newsletter subscribe 429 with minimal details (ip, key, route).
  - **Why**: consistent visibility for public-facing throttles
  - **Impact**: incident traceability without storing content/PII

- [x] Emit `security.ratelimit.block` on login throttles (per-IP and per-email) in authorize() flow.
  - **Why**: detect credential stuffing and abusive login attempts
  - **Impact**: improved SOC telemetry; no user enumeration in responses

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Final sweep for any other 429 paths; document any intentional exclusions due to volume/noise.

---
## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Audited applyRateLimit and rateLimitAsync usage to confirm `security.ratelimit.block` audit logging on all 429 response paths.
  - **Why**: final sweep to verify telemetry coverage for throttled requests
  - **Impact**: ensures incident responders receive consistent audit data across admin, portal, and public endpoints

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- Legacy `rateLimit()` helper remains exported; future code should prefer `applyRateLimit` or add explicit audits to avoid regressions.

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] None

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Evaluate deprecating or wrapping legacy `rateLimit()` helper with audit logging to enforce consistency.

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Prepared Prisma migration to add `superAdmin` JSON column to `security_settings` and updated seed to ensure defaults.
  - **Why**: enable persistent tenant-level SUPER_ADMIN overrides (stepUpMfa, logAdminAccess)
  - **Impact**: consistent defaults; safe, backward-compatible rollout

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Awaiting remote DB credentials (NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL) and target environment (staging/prod) to apply migration and seed.

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Apply migration and seed
  1. Set NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL to the remote Postgres connection string.
  2. Run: pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:seed
  3. Verify:
     - SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='security_settings' AND column_name='superAdmin';
     - SELECT superAdmin FROM public.security_settings LIMIT 5;

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Set NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL and DATABASE_URL for remote Neon DB (via dev server env config).
  - **Why**: enable Prisma to target the remote database for migration/seed
  - **Impact**: environment prepared for schema changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- ACL blocked running migration/seed commands from this environment.
  - Operators must execute: `pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:seed` in a shell with the same NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL.

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Ops: Run migrations and seed as above, then verify column and sample values exist as documented. Provide confirmation or logs to record in this file.

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Applied migrations to Neon and ran seed with resilience; superAdmin JSON present and defaults ensured.
  - **Why**: finalize tenant-level SUPER_ADMIN overrides persistence
  - **Impact**: stepUpMfa/logAdminAccess now persisted per-tenant; seed succeeds even if legacy Task schema lags

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- Remote DB missing `Task.tenantId`; task/compliance seed skipped to avoid failure. DB schema may be out-of-sync with current Prisma models.

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Ops: plan follow-up migration to align Task schema (ensure `Task.tenantId` exists) or confirm intentional divergence. Re-run seeding for tasks once aligned.
