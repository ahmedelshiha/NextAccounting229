## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Applied migrations to Neon and ran seed with resilience; superAdmin JSON present and defaults ensured.
  - **Why**: finalize tenant-level SUPER_ADMIN overrides persistence
  - **Impact**: stepUpMfa/logAdminAccess now persisted per-tenant; seed succeeds even if legacy Task schema lags

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- Remote DB missing `Task.tenantId`; task/compliance seed skipped to avoid failure. DB schema may be out-of-sync with current Prisma models.

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Ops: plan follow-up migration to align Task schema (ensure `Task.tenantId` exists) or confirm intentional divergence. Re-run seeding for tasks once aligned.
