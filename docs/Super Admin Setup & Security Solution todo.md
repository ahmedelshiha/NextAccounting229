## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Wired AdminAuditsPage to use /api/admin/audit-logs for SUPER_ADMIN; legacy activity endpoint remains for others.
  - **Why**: correct data source based on privileges
  - **Impact**: SUPER_ADMINs see full audit logs; others see activity view
- [x] Added IP policy block audit in middleware (action: security.ip.block) with graceful edge fallback.
  - **Why**: traceability of access denials
  - **Impact**: improved incident visibility
- [x] Shipped emergency scripts: scripts/admin-setup/reset-password.ts and scripts/admin-setup/disable-mfa.ts
  - **Why**: recovery procedures
  - **Impact**: rapid response for lockouts and MFA issues
- [x] Enforced super admin session IP binding with configurable toggle (SUPERADMIN_STRICT_IP_ENFORCEMENT).
  - **Why**: protects privileged sessions from network hijacking or replay
  - **Impact**: super admin sessions require consistent network origin before accessing admin surfaces
- [x] Added audit telemetry and logging for super admin IP mismatch enforcement.
  - **Why**: ensures forced reauthentication events are discoverable
  - **Impact**: incident responders can rapidly trace unauthorized network shifts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- Enabling SUPERADMIN_STRICT_IP_ENFORCEMENT immediately invalidates existing super admin sessions; coordinate rollout windows to avoid disruption.
- IP binding depends on accurate upstream client IP headers; verify proxy configuration before enabling in production environments.

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] None ‚Äì ready for next super admin security hardening task

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Plan staged rollout for SUPERADMIN_STRICT_IP_ENFORCEMENT (staging ‚Üí production) and monitor audit noise.
- [ ] Evaluate introducing step-up MFA prompts for super admin critical workflows post-IP validation.
