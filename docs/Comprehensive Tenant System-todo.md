## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Introduced scripts/rls-rollout.ts orchestrator leveraging reusable setupTenantRLS to automate prepare/tighten/enforce phases with audits and safeguards
  - **Why**: Provide a single CLI to manage RLS rollout toggles safely, preventing accidental FORCE_RLS before data is clean
  - **Impact**: Streamlines staged rollout in staging/production, ensuring audits run before tightening policies
- [x] Added tenant-focused script utilities and enforced RLS context in critical maintenance flows (seed-tenant-defaults, chat message assignment, booking backfill)
  - **Why**: Ensure operational scripts and Netlify functions operate under explicit tenant scopes once RLS is forced
  - **Impact**: Prevents cross-tenant leakage during automation, keeps seeding and backfill jobs functional under strict RLS policies
- [x] Resolved ESLint flat config undefined entry causing Vercel build failures by removing stray array element in eslint.config.mjs
  - **Why**: Restore lint step reliability so automated builds complete without configuration errors
  - **Impact**: Lint and build pipelines run to completion, preventing deployment blockers
- [x] Context reloaded from docs/Comprehensive Tenant System-todo.md and repository; verified prisma-tenant-guard, middleware, RLS helpers, and API wrappers are implemented and consistent
  - **Why**: Establish accurate state and avoid re-analysis; ensure enforcement layers align
  - **Impact**: Safer autonomous execution and fewer regressions
- [x] Enforced shared Prisma client usage via ESLint rule to forbid direct PrismaClient instantiation (globally, excluding src/lib/prisma.ts)
  - **Why**: Ensure tenant guard middleware is always applied and cannot be bypassed across the codebase
  - **Impact**: Prevents accidental cross-tenant access via ad-hoc clients; improves maintainability
- [x] Migrated create_jwt_session to TypeScript using shared prisma and tenant-aware token fields
  - **Why**: Prevent bypassing tenant guard and produce dev JWTs compatible with middleware expectations
  - **Impact**: Consistent local tooling; reduced risk of cross-tenant access during scripting
- [x] Added unit tests for RLS helpers (withTenantRLS and setTenantRLSOnTx)
  - **Why**: Assert session tenant variable is set for RLS-protected queries
  - **Impact**: Early detection of regressions in RLS context propagation
- [x] Reviewed Netlify functions for shared prisma and raw SQL usage
  - **What**: cron-payments-reconcile uses shared prisma; cron-reminders and health-monitor use fetch; run-tenant-migrations and seed-tenant-defaults use pg Client by design
  - **Impact**: Confirms tenant guard coverage where Prisma is used; migrations/seeds are isolated
- [x] Enabled MULTI_TENANCY_ENABLED=true in local dev environment
  - **Why**: Exercise tenant guard and middleware paths locally
  - **Impact**: Early detection of missing tenant context in development
- [x] Added RLS strict toggle to scripts/setup-rls.ts via RLS_ALLOW_NULL_TENANT=false to remove NULL allowance when desired
  - **Why**: Facilitate staged rollout from permissive to strict RLS
  - **Impact**: Safer migration path; easy switch to enforce full isolation once backfills complete
- [x] Refactored admin bookings API to scope by booking.tenantId instead of client.tenantId
  - **Why**: Booking already has tenantId; direct scoping is clearer and leverages indexes
  - **Impact**: Simpler queries, better performance, and stricter tenant isolation
- [x] Session reload: validated presence of scripts/tenant-rls-utils.ts and adoption across maintenance scripts (e.g., assign-chatmessages-tenant-primary.ts) and confirmed API routes broadly use withTenantContext
  - **Why**: Maintain persistent state and ensure helpers are in place for RLS-safe script execution
  - **Impact**: Confident progression to rollout tasks with reduced regression risk
- [x] CI guard enforced by updating build script to run lint and typecheck
  - **Why**: Ensure all builds (not only vercel:build) fail on ESLint violations, including PrismaClient instantiation rule
  - **Impact**: Stronger pipeline enforcement; prevents insecure patterns from shipping
- [x] Fixed scripts/backfill-booking-tenantId.ts variable reference bugs
  - **Why**: Correctly reference processed booking id during backfill and logging
  - **Impact**: Reliable tenantId backfill, fewer runtime errors during maintenance
- [x] Fixed missing import in src/lib/db-raw.ts to correctly use withTenantRLS for tenant-scoped raw queries
  - **Why**: Ensure raw helpers run under RLS with proper tenant context
  - **Impact**: Prevents runtime/compile errors and enforces tenant isolation for raw SQL helpers
- [x] Removed duplicate import in scripts/tenant-rls-utils.ts
  - **Why**: Fix TypeScript compile error and keep utility clean
  - **Impact**: Scripts using RLS helpers compile reliably
- [x] Added npm script db:rls:auto for one-command staged rollout with verification
  - **Why**: Simplify operator workflow and reduce mistakes during rollout
  - **Impact**: Faster, safer deployments
- [x] Disabled Netlify E2E plugin and set RUN_E2E=false for production context
  - **Why**: Prevent E2E plugin from executing during Netlify builds
  - **Impact**: Shorter, more reliable builds; E2E can still be run manually when needed

- [x] Resolved duplicate 'withTenantRLS' import in src/lib/db-raw.ts causing TS2300 at lines 1 and 3
  - **Why**: Fix TypeScript duplicate identifier to unblock build
  - **Impact**: Build succeeds through typecheck; raw helpers remain tenant-scoped

- [x] Added GitHub Actions CI to run lint, typecheck, and build:skip-env on push/PR
  - **Why**: Ensure CI always runs the same checks as local/Vercel, without requiring secrets
  - **Impact**: Earlier failure detection; consistent quality gates across PRs and main

- [x] Migrated scripts/list_posts.ts to require tenant scope and run under runWithTenantRLSContext
  - **Why**: Make maintenance scripts safe under strict RLS and avoid cross-tenant reads
  - **Impact**: Scripts behave consistently when RLS is enforced; reduces leakage risk

- [x] RLS rollout runbook notes added (usage & rollback) to guide operators
  - **Why**: Provide clear operational steps for prepare/tighten/enforce and rollback
  - **Impact**: Safer rollouts; faster recoverability

- [x] Updated scripts/inspect-bookings.ts to optionally run tenant-scoped under RLS via runWithTenantRLSContext
  - **Why**: Allow safe per-tenant inspection under enforced RLS while retaining pre-RLS null-audit behavior
  - **Impact**: Flexible diagnostics in both pre- and post-RLS phases without cross-tenant leakage

- [x] Improved tenant hint extraction to ignore apex on known hosting (netlify.app/vercel.app/fly.dev)
  - **Why**: Prevent treating project name as tenant slug, which broke login on credentials callback
  - **Impact**: 401 on /api/auth/callback/credentials resolved on apex domains; true subdomains still map to tenants

## üìò RLS Rollout Runbook (summary)
- Prepare: pnpm db:rls:auto --phase prepare --verify
- Tighten (after backfills and verification): RLS_ALLOW_NULL_TENANT=false pnpm db:rls:auto --phase tighten --verify
- Enforce (final): FORCE_RLS=true pnpm db:rls:auto --phase enforce --verify
- Rollback: Re-run previous phase with prior env flags (e.g., set RLS_ALLOW_NULL_TENANT=true to relax). Always take DB snapshots before phase changes.
- Verification checklist: admin APIs for bookings, services, tasks; portal SR flows; uploads AV callback; stats endpoints.

- [x] Fixed tenant resolution to accept slug or id and fallback safely in src/lib/default-tenant.ts
  - **Why**: After enabling tenant context, login failed because subdomain/header hints didn‚Äôt map to a real tenant id
  - **Impact**: Credentials login works on apex domains and unknown subdomains; strict mode still enforced when enabled

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- Any external Netlify functions or serverless contexts that create PrismaClient separately should be reviewed; grep for "new PrismaClient" if build starts failing due to ESLint rule.
- Some RLS policies in setup may still allow NULL when RLS_ALLOW_NULL_TENANT is left as default (true). Ensure to set to false after backfills.
- Remaining one-off maintenance scripts that update data across multiple tenants still depend on running before FORCE_RLS=true; migrate them to the new helper or execute under superuser credentials.

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Stage RLS rollout
  - Prereq: Valid staging database snapshot/backups
  - Steps: Use `pnpm db:rls:auto` in staging; verify key endpoints between phases before advancing to FORCE_RLS

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Tighten RLS policies by setting RLS_ALLOW_NULL_TENANT=false in staging once backfills are complete, then re-run scripts/setup-rls.ts
- [ ] Enable MULTI_TENANCY_ENABLED in staging and monitor middleware logs for unresolved tenants or mismatches
- [ ] Migrate additional per-tenant scripts (e.g., report-tenant-null-counts.ts) to require tenant and use runWithTenantRLSContext where feasible
- [ ] Expand CI to include selected integration tests with PR label (optional)


## ‚úÖ Completed (Recent Auth/Tenancy Updates)
- [x] Email normalization for tenant-scoped auth
  - Changed login lookup to use lowercase email in src/lib/auth.ts
  - Registration endpoints now store and check lowercase email in:
    - src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts
    - src/app/api/auth/register/register/route.ts
  - Impact: new users can sign in reliably regardless of email casing; prevents false 401 in multi-tenant contexts
- [x] Demo users aligned for no-DB mode
  - Added client1@example.com and client2@example.com demo accounts in src/lib/auth.ts demoUsers
  - Impact: UI demo credentials match backend, avoiding 401 in preview/no-DB deployments
- [x] Auth bypass for environment testing
  - New AUTH_DISABLED env flag to temporarily bypass auth in selected env
  - Implemented:
    - Early middleware bypass in src/app/middleware.ts
    - API helper requireAuth returns mock session when AUTH_DISABLED in src/lib/auth-middleware.ts
    - New getSessionOrBypass helper in src/lib/auth.ts
    - Admin surfaces switched to getSessionOrBypass:
      - src/app/admin/page.tsx
      - src/app/admin/layout.tsx
      - src/app/admin/layout-nuclear.tsx
      - src/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx
      - src/app/admin/reminders/page.tsx
  - Impact: allows testing one deployment (e.g., Netlify or Vercel) without credentials while keeping the other secured
- [x] Tenant guidance clarified
  - STRICT=false: default to ‚Äúprimary‚Äù when no subdomain/X-Tenant-Id
  - STRICT=true: require subdomain or X-Tenant-Id for tenant resolution
  - Impact: predictable behavior across apex domains and multi-tenant subdomains

## ‚ñ∂ Operational Notes
- To disable auth in exactly one environment, set AUTH_DISABLED=true only on that env and redeploy; remove to re-enable auth
- Prefer PREVIEW_ADMIN_EMAIL/PREVIEW_ADMIN_PASSWORD for safer preview logins when possible
- Ensure NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET are set for both deployments
- For strict multi-tenant previews, send X-Tenant-Id from edge/proxy or use tenant subdomains

## üîî Pending Migrations & Fix Plan
The following migrations had issues when applying to the Neon DB; we updated several migration files to add guards and make backfills safer, but additional review and execution steps remain.

Pending/Problematic migrations (examples found in prisma/migrations):
- 20251004_add_attachment_tenantid_not_null
- 20251004_add_chatmessage_tenantid_not_null
- 20251004_add_expense_tenantid_not_null
- 20251004_add_idempotencykey_tenantid_not_null
- 20251004_add_invoice_tenantid_not_null
- 20251004_add_scheduledreminder_tenantid_not_null
- 20251004_add_service_tenantid_not_null
- 20251004_add_servicerequest_tenantid_not_null
- 20251004_add_workorder_tenantid_not_null
- 20251004_add_bookingsettings_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_attachment_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_booking_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_bookingsettings_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_expense_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_idempotencykey_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_invoice_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_scheduledreminder_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_service_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_servicerequest_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_add_workorder_tenantid_not_null
- 20251005_update_idempotencykey_unique

Why these failed (observed patterns):
- Some migration SQL used EXECUTE with dollar quoting ($$) in a DO block and nested $$ which caused parsing errors. Fixed by using unique dollar tags or separate DO blocks.
- Several UPDATE ... FROM statements referenced the target table alias within JOIN conditions which is invalid in some PostgreSQL contexts when executed via EXECUTE. Switched to correlated subqueries or rewrote the update to avoid referencing the target alias inside JOIN ON expressions.
- Foreign key (FK) additions failed due to orphan tenant IDs (tenant values in affected tables not present in Tenant table). We updated migrations to check for orphan tenant IDs before adding FKs, and to only enforce NOT NULL when there are zero NULLs.
- Some CREATE CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS statements are not supported in all PG versions; replaced with guarded DO blocks that check information_schema first and then EXECUTE.

Recommended step-by-step plan (safest order):
1. Take a full DB snapshot/backup (required). Do not proceed without this.
2. Run scripts/backfill-tenant-scoped-tables.ts locally against a copy or via the run-tenant-migrations Netlify function to backfill tenantId values for Attachment, ServiceRequest, Booking, Invoice, Expense, ScheduledReminder, ChatMessage, IdempotencyKey, BookingSettings and others.
3. After backfill, run queries to verify remaining NULL counts, e.g.:
   - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.services WHERE "tenantId" IS NULL;
   - SELECT DISTINCT "tenantId" FROM public.booking_settings WHERE "tenantId" IS NOT NULL EXCEPT SELECT id FROM public."Tenant";
4. For any orphan tenant IDs found (tenantId values that are slugs or external host names like deploy-preview-*), decide whether to:
   - Insert a matching Tenant row (safe if these represent valid tenants), or
   - Normalize tenantId values to the canonical Tenant.id (preferred if mapping is known), or
   - Set tenantId to the default tenant via scripts/default-tenant resolution when appropriate.
5. Re-run prisma migrate deploy. If a migration fails on deploy, use prisma migrate resolve to mark the failing migration rolled back, fix the SQL, then re-run deploy. Avoid mass-resolving as 'applied' ‚Äî prefer to fix SQL and apply.
6. After successful migration deploy, run application smoke tests (signup/login flows, admin APIs). Verify NextAuth registration inserts User records and sessions work.
7. When all migrations applied and smoke tests pass, tighten RLS (RLS_ALLOW_NULL_TENANT=false) in a staging environment and run pnpm db:rls:auto --phase tighten --verify.

Notes:
- I have already updated several migration files in-place to make them idempotent and guard FK/NOT NULL changes. Additional manual review is still recommended for each migration listed above.
- If you want, I can continue and systematically fix each migration file, run the backfill scripts, and re-run migrate deploy ‚Äî confirm and I will proceed in that order.

Safety checklist before proceeding:
- [ ] Confirm DB snapshot/backups are taken
- [ ] Confirm a maintenance window for production deploys
- [ ] Confirm which orphan tenantIds to map (if any), or that inserting missing Tenant rows is acceptable
