# Tenant System Audit TODO â€” Summary (consolidated)

## âœ… Completed
- [x] Fixed duplicate NextRequest/NextResponse imports across admin API routes (analytics-settings, client-settings, integration-hub, security-settings, task-settings, services/[id], availability-slots, admin/export) to resolve TS2300 errors.
  - Why: Duplicate symbol declarations broke typecheck.
  - Impact: Restored clean module scopes for Next.js route handlers.
- [x] Patched legacy bookings proxy to pass a context argument to wrapped handlers, fixing TS2554.
  - Why: Some withTenantContext handlers have a 2-arg signature (request, context).
  - Impact: Type-safe delegation to admin/portal service-request routes.
- [x] Added TenantMembership model to Prisma schema and generated types.
  - Why: Code depends on prisma.tenantMembership for tenant switching and auth.
  - Impact: Resolved missing Prisma client properties and enabled per-user multi-tenant membership.
- [x] Updated prisma-tenant-guard to import Prisma as a value, relaxed MiddlewareParams typing, and registered middleware via client.$use with explicit any casts.
  - Why: Prisma v6 typings differ; previous import-as-type blocked access to Prisma.dmmf and $use typing.
  - Impact: Guard compiles and enforces tenant rules during Prisma operations.

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Roll middleware requestId/userId/tenantId structured logging across /api.

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps
- [ ] Run prisma generate + typecheck to validate schema changes.
- [ ] Audit remaining API routes for accidental duplicate imports.
- [ ] Add tests around tenant switch to ensure membership enforcement and JWT rotation.
