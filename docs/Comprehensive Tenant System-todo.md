# Comprehensive Tenant System - AI Agent TODO System

**Version:** 5.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-10-04

**Mission:** Harden, standardize and complete multi-tenant isolation and lifecycle across middleware, API, Prisma, schema and tests.

**Timeline:** 12 weeks | **Current Phase:** PHASE 1

---

## CRITICAL METRICS
- Tenant Isolation Incidents: 0/0 (‚Äî) ‚úÖ
- Routes migrated to withTenantContext: 124/150 (82.6%) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Prisma tenant-guard coverage (critical models): 100%/100% (100%) ‚úÖ
- Tests covering tenant-mismatch cases: 2/10 (20%) ‚ùå

Status Icons: ‚ùå (Critical), ‚ö†Ô∏è (Warning), ‚úÖ (Complete)

---

## PROGRESS TRACKING
- Overall Progress: 70%
- Phase 0: 60% (planning/requirements captured)
- Phase 1 (Middleware & API hardening): 92% (completed/total)
- Phase 2 (Schema & DB safety): 30% (planning in progress)
- Phase 3 (RLS & Prisma middleware): 10%

**Next Milestone:** Complete refactor of remaining server routes and add 8 tenant-mismatch integration tests ‚Äî ETA 2025-11-01

**Bottlenecks:**
1. High: Schema tightening (NOT NULL tenantId) requires data backfill and migrations
2. Medium: Add robust integration tests for tenant mismatch and cookie invalidation
3. Other: Monitoring and Sentry tagging per-tenant still partial

## AI Agent Update ‚Äî Batch A Completed (2025-10-04)

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Batch A migrations applied to the codebase (auth-adjacent endpoints)
  - Files updated:
    - src/app/api/payments/checkout/route.ts
    - src/app/api/payments/cod/route.ts
    - src/app/api/email/test/route.ts
    - src/app/api/admin/auth/logout/route.ts
  - Why: Replace direct getServerSession usage with withTenantContext + requireTenantContext to ensure tenant_sig verification, AsyncLocalStorage tenantContext propagation, and cookie validation.
  - Impact: These endpoints now run inside tenantContext, preventing unaudited session usage and enabling tenant-scoped checks and logging.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks
- Integration tests not yet run; run pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && targeted integration tests (tenant-isolation, tenant-mismatch).
- There may be additional application-level assumptions relying on session object shape; monitor Sentry for regressions after rollout.

## üöß In Progress
- [ ] Batch B planned migrations
- [ ] Add integration tests asserting 403 on invalid tenant_sig for Batch A endpoints

## üîß Next Steps
- [ ] Run CI checks and targeted integration tests for Batch A
- [ ] Proceed with Batch B when CI green
- [ ] Create PR and include changelog entry describing the tenant hardening changes
