# Admin Services Module – Enhancement Plan (Status)

## ✅ What was completed
- [x] Phase 1 — Foundations
  - [x] Define Services domain types (src/types/services.ts)
  - [x] Add Zod schemas for validation (src/schemas/services.ts)
  - [x] Implement utilities (slug, sanitize, filters/sorts, metrics, bulk validation) (src/lib/services/utils.ts)
  - [x] Add debounce hook and permissions hook (src/hooks/useDebounce.ts, src/hooks/useServicesPermissions.ts)
  - [x] Add data hook for services (src/hooks/useServicesData.ts)
  - [x] Add cache and notification service (no-op safe) (src/lib/cache.service.ts, src/lib/notification.service.ts)
  - [x] Implement ServicesService business layer (src/services/services.service.ts)
  - [x] Add admin APIs: list/create, get/update/delete, bulk, stats, export (src/app/api/admin/services/**)
  - [x] Extend permissions to include services.* and update role mapping (src/lib/permissions.ts)

- [x] Phase 2 — Core UI components
  - [x] ServicesHeader (src/components/admin/services/ServicesHeader.tsx)
  - [x] ServicesFilters (src/components/admin/services/ServicesFilters.tsx)
  - [x] ServiceCard (src/components/admin/services/ServiceCard.tsx)
  - [x] ServiceForm (src/components/admin/services/ServiceForm.tsx)
  - [x] BulkActionsPanel (src/components/admin/services/BulkActionsPanel.tsx)
  - [x] ServicesAnalytics (src/components/admin/services/ServicesAnalytics.tsx)

## ✅ Why it was done
- Provide a production-grade, type-safe, and extensible foundation for services management.
- Enforce validation, RBAC, rate limiting and audit logging at the API and business layers.
- Implement reusable UI primitives that align with existing design system and ease migration of the admin page.
- Ensure safe operation in demo/no-DB environments (no hard failures when NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL is not set).

## ✅ Next steps (remaining / actionable)

A) Wire Admin Services page
- [ ] Layout: render ServicesHeader, ServicesFilters, and ServiceCard grid in src/app/admin/services/page.tsx
  - [ ] Data: fetch via services.service + hooks; apply filters/sort/pagination
  - [ ] States: loading, empty, and error with retry
- [ ] Card actions: view/edit/enable/disable/delete
  - [ ] Confirmations + success/error toasts
  - [ ] Enforce RBAC with PermissionGate

B) Create/Edit modals
- [ ] Accessible modal scaffolding (focus trap, keyboard, aria)
- [ ] Wire ServiceForm for create and update
- [ ] Submit to APIs with optimistic UI + cache revalidation

C) Bulk actions & selection
- [ ] Selection state (works across pagination)
- [ ] Bulk enable/disable/delete/export via BulkActionsPanel
- [ ] Progress indicator + error aggregation; undo when possible

D) Analytics wiring
- [ ] Fetch GET /api/admin/services/stats via SWR with caching
- [ ] Handle loading/error/skeletons
- [ ] Integrate ServicesAnalytics into the page

E) Testing
- [ ] Unit: zod schemas, utils, services.service
- [ ] Integration: admin services APIs (list/create/update/delete/bulk/export)
- [ ] Component: services page interactions (filters, modals, bulk actions)

F) Quality gates
- [ ] Typecheck + ESLint pass
- [ ] Perf sanity (no heavy blocking charts); no layout shifts

G) Deployability (Netlify)
- [ ] Verify envs (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_URL, STRIPE as needed)
- [ ] prisma generate on build; functions bundling config
- [ ] Safe cache headers for API responses where applicable
- [ ] Preview deploy and smoke tests
