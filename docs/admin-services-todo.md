# Admin Services â€“ Progress Log

## Completed
- Foundations implemented:
  - Domain types and Zod schemas
  - Utilities (slug, sanitize, filter/sort, validation)
  - Hooks (permissions, data, debounce)
  - Cache and notification services (no-op safe)
  - ServicesService business layer (Prisma + multi-tenant aware)
  - Admin APIs: list/create, get/update/delete, bulk, stats, export
  - Permissions extended (services.*) for ADMIN/TEAM roles

## Why
- Establish a production-grade, reusable backbone for the enhanced admin/services module
- Enforce validation, RBAC, rate limits, and audit hooks
- Enable clean UI migration with stable contracts

## Next steps
- Build modular UI components (header, filters, card, form, bulk, analytics)
- Gradually migrate admin/services page to new components/hooks
- Add CSV/JSON export controls in UI and confirm Netlify headers
