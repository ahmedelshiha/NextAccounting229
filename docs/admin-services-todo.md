# Admin Services Module – Enhancement Plan (Status)

## ✅ What was completed
- [x] Phase 1 — Foundations
  - [x] Define Services domain types (src/types/services.ts)
  - [x] Add Zod schemas for validation (src/schemas/services.ts)
  - [x] Implement utilities (slug, sanitize, filters/sorts, metrics, bulk validation) (src/lib/services/utils.ts)
  - [x] Add debounce hook and permissions hook (src/hooks/useDebounce.ts, src/hooks/useServicesPermissions.ts)
  - [x] Add data hook for services (src/hooks/useServicesData.ts)
  - [x] Add cache and notification service (no-op safe) (src/lib/cache.service.ts, src/lib/notification.service.ts)
  - [x] Implement ServicesService business layer (src/services/services.service.ts)
  - [x] Add admin APIs: list/create, get/update/delete, bulk, stats, export (src/app/api/admin/services/**)
  - [x] Extend permissions to include services.* and update role mapping (src/lib/permissions.ts)

- [x] Phase 2 — Core UI components
  - [x] ServicesHeader (src/components/admin/services/ServicesHeader.tsx)
  - [x] ServicesFilters (src/components/admin/services/ServicesFilters.tsx)
  - [x] ServiceCard (src/components/admin/services/ServiceCard.tsx)
  - [x] ServiceForm (src/components/admin/services/ServiceForm.tsx)
  - [x] BulkActionsPanel (src/components/admin/services/BulkActionsPanel.tsx)
  - [x] ServicesAnalytics (src/components/admin/services/ServicesAnalytics.tsx)

## ✅ Why it was done
- Provide a production-grade, type-safe, and extensible foundation for services management.
- Enforce validation, RBAC, rate limiting and audit logging at the API and business layers.
- Implement reusable UI primitives that align with existing design system and ease migration of the admin page.
- Ensure safe operation in demo/no-DB environments (no hard failures when NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL is not set).

## ✅ Next steps (remaining / actionable)
- [ ] Integrate ServicesHeader, ServicesFilters, ServiceGrid (cards) into admin page (wire components into src/app/admin/services/page.tsx)
- [ ] Add Edit/Create modals using ServiceForm (ensure modal accessibility and large-screen layout)
- [ ] Add selection state and BulkActions integration into the admin page
- [ ] Wire ServicesAnalytics to GET /api/admin/services/stats and render live data
- [ ] Add automated unit tests for utilities and service layer (zod validations + service business logic)
- [ ] Add integration tests for admin APIs (list/create/update/delete/bulk/export)
- [ ] Run full typecheck & lint; address any remaining TypeScript or ESLint issues
- [ ] Prepare Netlify deployment checklist (env vars, build settings, headers) and run preview deploy
