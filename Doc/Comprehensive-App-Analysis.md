## 4) Services System

Model Service: id, name, slug, description, shortDesc, features[], price (Decimal), duration, category, active, featured, image, timestamps.
APIs:
- GET /api/services (?featured=true&category=...)
- POST /api/services (validates unique slug, typed fields)
- GET /api/services/[slug]
Admin listing also available under /api/admin/services.
UI mapping in booking wizard: estimates hours, sets complexity by duration, derives requirements from features.

## 5) Booking System

- Admin 5-step wizard (src/app/admin/bookings/new/page.tsx) with gating and review; assigned staff is mocked for now; location choices (office/remote/client site).
- POST /api/bookings: validates payload, verifies service, checks conflict window (±1h), selects clientId (admin may specify), persists booking with duration.
- GET /api/bookings: role-filtered (CLIENT sees own; ADMIN/STAFF can filter by userId).
- POST /api/bookings/[id]/confirm: marks confirmed and can send email; ICS generation available in lib/email.ts.

## 6) Business Intelligence & Admin Enhancements

- Admin Stats (GET /api/admin/stats/bookings): totals by status, today/this month/last month, growth%, upcoming, revenue aggregates (decimal-safe), optional ranges (7d/30d/90d/1y).
- Admin Analytics (GET /api/admin/analytics): daily bookings series, revenue by service, avg lead time, top services.
- Perf Metrics snapshot (GET /api/admin/perf-metrics): structure for integrating real metrics (Sentry, Lighthouse, Netlify).
- RBAC & Audit: src/lib/rbac.ts permissions; src/lib/audit.ts logs; enforced in admin APIs (users, currencies, etc.).
- Admin UI: Dashboard quick actions, users/roles, audits viewer, currencies manager with refresh/export/overrides.

## 7) Client Portal Enhancements

- Profile management with current-password requirement for sensitive changes, bcrypt verification, sessionVersion bump to invalidate other sessions.
- Endpoints: GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/users/me; bookings pages server-side secured detail; filters, CSV export, cancellation for upcoming bookings.

## 8) Multilingual & RTL

- Locales: en, ar (RTL), hi; helpers in src/app/lib/i18n.ts for formatting numbers/currency/date.
- UI adapts direction and layout; language switcher in header; translations stored in JSON files.

## 9) Multi-Currency Implementation

- Models: Currency, ExchangeRate, PriceOverride with relations/indices.
- Exchange rates via exchangerate.host; TTL; persisted and updated through src/lib/exchange.ts.
- Admin Currencies:
  - GET/POST /api/admin/currencies; PATCH /api/admin/currencies/[code]
  - POST /api/admin/currencies/refresh; GET /api/admin/currencies/export
  - GET/POST /api/admin/currencies/overrides
- Public:
  - GET /api/currencies; GET /api/currencies/convert
- Admin UI: src/components/admin/currency-manager.tsx and /admin/settings/currencies.
- Strategy: canonical USD base pricing with converted display and optional per-currency overrides; cron endpoint for refresh: POST /api/cron/refresh-exchange-rates (x-cron-secret).

## 10) Technical Highlights

## 12) Database Schema Alignment & Flows

- Core tables: User/Account/Session/VerificationToken, Service, Booking, Post, Currency/ExchangeRate/PriceOverride, Newsletter, ContactSubmission, Task, HealthLog.
- Booking Flow:
  1) Client/admin posts serviceId, scheduledAt, client details
