# Client Portal Enhancements — Implementation Notes

This document summarizes the client-portal related changes implemented and where to find them in the codebase.

Purpose
- Harden profile management: require current password for sensitive changes, support account deletion with password confirmation, and immediately persist changes to the database.
- Invalidate other sessions when sensitive information changes (email/password).
- Add a client settings UI so clients can update their profile.
- Improve bookings experience in the portal (list, detail pages, cancel/export, filters, and server-side detail rendering).
- Fix various build/runtime issues and improve API fetch resilience.

Files added / modified

1) Profile management (API & UI)
- API: `src/app/api/users/me/route.ts`
  - GET: returns current user's id, name, email, role.
  - PATCH: accepts optional `name`, `email`, `password`, and `currentPassword`.
    - Requires `currentPassword` when changing email or password; verifies with bcrypt.
    - Hashes new password and updates user record.
    - Increments `sessionVersion` in DB to invalidate existing JWT-based sessions.
    - Returns updated user (id, name, email) and logs the action via `logAudit`.
  - DELETE: requires `password` in request body; verifies and deletes the user record (cascades to sessions/accounts/bookings), logs audit.

- UI: `src/app/portal/settings/page.tsx`
  - New settings page allowing clients to update name, email, password.
  - Requires entering the current password when changing email or password.
  - Sends `currentPassword` in PATCH payload when required.
  - After sensitive change (email/password) the client is signed out (to refresh session tokens).
  - Delete account flow uses a confirmation dialog and requires current password.

2) Session invalidation and NextAuth integration
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
  - Added `sessionVersion Int @default(0)` column on the User model.
  - This allows invalidating JWT sessions by bumping the sessionVersion.

- Auth callbacks: `src/lib/auth.ts`
  - JWT callback attaches `sessionVersion` to tokens on sign-in.
  - On subsequent JWT callback runs, the code compares the token's `sessionVersion` to the DB value; when mismatched it flags the token as invalidated.
  - Session callback returns `null` when token is flagged invalidated, forcing sign-in.

3) Portal bookings UX improvements
- Listing: `src/app/portal/page.tsx`
  - Added filters (upcoming / past / all), CSV export, and cancel button for upcoming booking entries.
  - Cancel action calls `DELETE /api/bookings/[id]` (API marks booking CANCELLED) and shows toast feedback.

- Detail: `src/app/portal/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Replaced client-side fetch page with a server component that uses `getServerSession` + Prisma to fetch booking and enforce permissions server-side. Returns `notFound()` when booking is missing or inaccessible.

- Listing (all): `src/app/portal/bookings/page.tsx`
  - New page listing all bookings for the logged-in user; supports viewing individual booking detail pages.

4) Booking creation & availability fixes
- `src/app/booking/page.tsx`
  - Improved availability parsing when calling `/api/bookings/availability` to support both shapes: `{ availability: [...] }` and direct array responses; picks day matching selected date when present.

5) Misc bug fixes & type safety
- `src/app/admin/bookings/new/page.tsx`
  - Fixed TypeScript errors by casting select values to BookingFormData literal types to satisfy strict typing in event handlers.

- `src/lib/api.ts`
  - Hardened `apiFetch` with improved logging and a relative-path fallback when origin-prefixed fetch fails in certain preview/proxy embedding environments.

- `src/components/home/services-section.tsx`
  - Added robust parsing and fallbacks for `/api/services` responses and uses static featured services when the API fails.

Why these changes
- User security: requiring the current password for sensitive updates prevents account takeovers when a user leaves a session open.
- Session consistency: bumping `sessionVersion` ensures other sessions are invalidated after a credential change.
- UX: Users expect to manage profile details themselves — the settings page provides that and ensures changes write directly to the DB.
- Robustness: server-side rendering of booking detail ensures proper authorization and avoids 404s created by client-side auth fetch failures.

How to test
1) Profile update
- Log in as a client. Open /portal/settings. Change name only → save; expect immediate UI update and no sign-out.
- Change email or password → provide current password → save; expect to be signed out and forced to log in with new credentials.

2) Delete account
- Open /portal/settings → Delete account → enter current password → confirm → you should be signed out and the user record removed (if DB configured).

3) Bookings
- Portal → view Upcoming / Past bookings → use filters, cancel an upcoming booking → status should become CANCELLED.
- Click View on a booking → booking detail page should load server-side or return 404 if unauthorized.

4) General
- Visit home page and verify services section loads fallback static content if API fails; check console for improved apiFetch logs when network errors occur.

Notes & follow-ups
- We used `sessionVersion` strategy with NextAuth (JWT sessions) to invalidate sessions. If you use a different session strategy or adapter, you may need to adapt the approach.
- For OAuth-only users (no local password), the code prevents local password flows; consider adding an email verification / set-password flow if needed.
- Consider adding audit messages (already done via `logAudit`) and rate-limiting for profile changes.

If you want, I can:
- Add an admin view showing user session versions and active sessions (for support)
- Implement soft-delete instead of hard-delete (retain data for compliance)
- Add email verification flow for email changes
