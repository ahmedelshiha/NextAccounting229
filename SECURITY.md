# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support security fixes on `main` and the latest released version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security reports.

- Use GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability") to submit a private report to maintainers.
- If advisories are unavailable, contact the maintainers privately via GitHub (owners/maintainers listed in the repository).

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours, provide an initial assessment within 5 business days, and regularly update you until resolution.

## Disclosure Policy
- We work to verify, patch, and release fixes before any public disclosure.
- We credit reporters who request acknowledgment after fixes are released.

## Safe Harbor
We support good-faith security research. Avoid data exfiltration and disruption. Respect privacy, and only test against your own accounts/tenants.

## Additional Guidance
Operational security and hardening guidelines are documented in `docs/SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md`.
